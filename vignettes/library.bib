abstract = {As whales recover from commercial exploitation, they are increasing in abundance in habitats that they have been absent from for decades. However, studying the recovery and habitat use patterns of whales, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions, frequently poses logistical and economic challenges. Here we trial a new approach for measuring whale density in a remote area, using Very-High-Resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery. This approach has capacity to provide sightings data to complement and assist traditional sightings surveys. We compare at-sea whale density estimates to estimates derived from satellite imagery collected at a similar time, and use suction-cup archival logger data to make an adjustment for surface availability. We demonstrate that satellite imagery can provide useful data on whale occurrence and density. Densities, when unadjusted for surface availability are shown to be considerably lower than those estimated by the ship survey. However, adjusted for surface availability and weather conditions (0.13 whales per km2, CV = 0.38), they fall within an order of magnitude of those derived by traditional line-transect estimates (0.33 whales per km2, CV = 0.09). Satellite surveys represent an exciting development for high-resolution image-based cetacean observation at sea, particularly in inaccessible regions, presenting opportunities for ongoing and future research.},

abstract = {Exxon Neftegas Limited, operator of the Sakhalin-1 consortium, is developing oil and gas reserves on the continental shelf off northeast Sakhalin Island, Russia. DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG), on behalf of the Sakhalin-1 consortium, conducted a 3-D seismic survey of the Odoptu license area during 17 August-September 2001. A portion of the primary known feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located adjacent to the seismic block. The data presented here were collected as part of daily monitoring to determine if there was any measurable effect of the seismic survey on the distribution and abundance of western gray whales. Mitigation and monitoring program included aerial surveys conducted between 19 July and 19 November using the methodology outlined by the Southern California High Energy Seismic Survey team (HESS). These surveys provided documentation of the distribution, abundance and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales in relation to seismic survey sounds. From an operations perspective, the aerial surveys provided near real-time data on the location of whales in and outside the feeding area, and documented whether whales were displaced out of an area normally used as feeding habitat. The objectives of this study were to assess (a) temporal changes in the distribution and abundance of gray whales in relation to seismic survey, and (b) the influence of seismic survey, environmental factors, and other variables on the distribution and abundance of gray whales within their preferred feeding area adjacent to Piltun Bay. Multiple regression analysis revealed a limited redistribution of gray whales southward within the Piltun feeding area when the seismic survey was fully operational. A total of five environmental and other variables unrelated to seismic survey (date and proxies of depth, sea state and visibility) and one seismic survey-related variable (seg3d, i.e., received sound energy accumulated over 3 days) had statistically significant effects on the distribution and abundance of gray whales. The distribution of two to four gray whales observed on the surface (i.e., about five to ten whales in total) has likely been affected by the seismic survey. However, the total number of gray whales observed within the Piltun feeding area remained stable during the seismic},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Environmental changes (a type of disturbance) are altering the habitat of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, an apex marine predator in the Southern Ocean. As a result, individuals may shift their behaviour, spending more time in transit and less time foraging. The effects of these sublethal changes in behaviour can accumulate, indirectly impacting lifetime fitness through changes in individual survival and reproduction. If a sufficient proportion of the population is affected, the probability of population persistence will be altered. We used data from long-term telemetry studies of female elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia, to model the effect of behaviour on the seals' health (i.e. all internal factors that affect homeostasis). Through simulation, we investigated the effect of increasing periods of behavioural shifts, quantifying how the exclusion of maternal southern elephant seals from foraging habitat may affect their health, offspring survival, individual fitness and population growth rate. A long period of altered behaviour (>50% of an average foraging trip at sea) in 1 yr resulted in a small (0.4%) decline in population size the following year. However, a persistent disruption (e.g. 30 yr), caused for example by the long-term effects of climate change, could result in a 0.3% decline in individual fitness and a 10% decline in population size. Our approach to estimating the long-term population effects of short-term changes in individual behaviour can be generalised to include physiological effects and other causes of behavioural and physiological disruption, such as anthropogenic disturbance, for any species.},

abstract = {Predators make foraging decisions based upon sensory information about resource availability, but little is known about how large, air-breathing predators collect and use such information to maximize energy returns when foraging in the deep sea. Here, we used archival tags to study how echolocating sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) use their long-range sensory capabilities to guide foraging in a deep-water habitat consisting of multiple, depth-segregated prey layers. Sperm whales employ a directed search behaviour by modulating their overall sonar sampling with the intention to exploit a particular prey layer. They forage opportunistically during some descents while actively adjusting their acoustic gaze to sequentially track different prey layers.While foraging within patches, sperm whales adjust their clicking rate both to search new water volumes as they turn and to match the prey distribution. This strategy increases information flow and suggests that sperm whales can perform auditory stream segregation of multiple targets when echolocating. Such flexibility in sampling tactics in concert with long-range sensing capabilities apparently allow sperm whales to efficiently locate and access prey resources in vast, heterogeneous, deep water habitats.},

abstract = {Sound-and-orientation recording tags (DTAGs) were used to study 10 beaked whales of two poorly known species, Ziphius cavirostris (Zc) and Mesoplodon densirostris (Md). Acoustic behaviour in the deep foraging dives performed by both species (Zc: 28 dives by seven individuals; Md: 16 dives by three individuals) shows that they hunt by echolocation in deep water between 222 and 1885 m, attempting to capture about 30 prey/dive. This food source is so deep that the average foraging dives were deeper (Zc: 1070 m; Md: 835 m) and longer (Zc: 58 min; Md: 47 min) than reported for any other air-breathing species. A series of shallower dives, containing no indications of foraging, followed most deep foraging dives. The average interval between deep foraging dives was 63 min for Zc and 92 min for Md. This long an interval may be required for beaked whales to recover from an oxygen debt accrued in the deep foraging dives, which last about twice the estimated aerobic dive limit. Recent reports of gas emboli in beaked whales stranded during naval sonar exercises have led to the hypothesis that their deep-diving may make them especially vulnerable to decompression. Using current models of breath-hold diving, we infer that their natural diving behaviour is inconsistent with known problems of acute nitrogen supersaturation and embolism. If the assumptions of these models are correct for beaked whales, then possible decompression problems are more likely to result from an abnormal behavioural response to sonar.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding in rorqual whales is a drag-based feeding mechanism that is thought to entail a high energetic cost and consequently limit the maximum dive time of these extraordinarily large predators. Although the kinematics of lunge feeding in fin whales supports this hypothesis, it is unclear whether respiratory compensation occurs as a consequence of lunge-feeding activity. We used high-resolution digital tags on foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) to determine the number of lunges executed per dive as well as respiratory frequency between dives. Data from two whales are reported, which together performed 58 foraging dives and 451 lunges. During one study, we tracked one tagged whale for approximately 2 h and examined the spatial distribution of prey using a digital echosounder. These data were integrated with the dive profile to reveal that lunges are directed toward the upper boundary of dense krill aggregations. Foraging dives were characterized by a gliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady swimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these extended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken after a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half of those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales. At the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate was at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that underwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high energetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also occurs in intermediate sized rorquals.},

abstract = {Rorqual whales exhibit an extreme lunge filter-feeding strategy characterized by acceleration to high speed and engulfment of a large volume of prey-laden water [1–4]. Although tagging studies have quantified the kinematics of lunge feeding, the timing of engulfment relative to body acceleration has been modeled conflictingly because it could never be directly measured [5–7]. The temporal coordination of these processes has a major impact on the hydrodynamics and energetics of this high-cost feeding strategy [5–9]. If engulfment and body acceleration are temporally distinct, the overall cost of this dynamic feeding event would be minimized. However, greater temporal overlap of these two phases would theoretically result in higher drag and greater energetic costs. To address this discrepancy, we used animal-borne synchronized video and 3D movement sensors to quantify the kinematics of both the skull and body during feeding events. Krill-feeding blue and humpback whales exhibited temporally distinct acceleration and engulfment phases, with humpback whales reaching maximum gape earlier than blue whales. In these whales, engulfment coincided largely with body deceleration; however, humpback whales pursuing more agile fish demonstrated highly variable coordination of skull and body kinematics in the context of complex prey-herding techniques. These data suggest that rorquals modulate the coordination of acceleration and engulfment to optimize foraging efficiency by minimizing locomotor costs and maximizing prey capture. Moreover, this newfound kinematic diversity observed among rorquals indicates that the energetic efficiency of foraging is driven both by the whale's engulfment capacity and the comparative locomotor capabilities of predator and prey.},

abstract = {Most models used for assessing the status of fish stocks and providing quantitative advice for fisheries management are not spatially explicit despite the well-known spatial heterogeneity of fish populations. Statistical spatial distribution modelling, which can derive spatially-resolved biomass from catch rates, is a method increasingly used to infer trends in population biomass, particularly where integrated population models are not available. Although the spatial distribution modelling tool VAST was developed to analyze survey data, such methods have also been used with fisheries-dependent catch and effort data, particularly when survey data are not available. We developed a statistical spatial distribution model for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean using the VAST (Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal model) approach. We based the VAST model on catch-rate (catch per unit effort) data from the long-line fishery and compared the biomass time series obtained to that of existing single-area and spatially-explicit integrated population models which have also been developed for this population. The time series obtained from the statistical spatial distribution modelling approach was highly variable between years, inconsistent with constraints imposed on population dynamics by biological parameters, and substantially different from biomass trends obtained from the integrated models. Although it has been used successfully in other analyses, in this instance, the spatial distribution modelling could not overcome fine-scale spatial and vessel-based variability in fishery catch rates to estimate the underlying abundance of toothfish at the scale of the Ross Sea region measurable with the more-informed integrated models.},

abstract = {In this article, we analyze the impacts of climate change on Antarctic marine ecosystems. Observations demonstrate large-scale changes in the physical variables and circulation of the Southern Ocean driven by warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and a positive Southern Annular Mode. Alterations in the physical environment are driving change through all levels of Antarctic marine food webs, which differ regionally. The distributions of key species, such as Antarctic krill, are also changing. Differential responses among predators reflect differences in species ecology. The impacts of climate change on Antarctic biodiversity will likely vary for different communities and depend on species range. Coastal communities and those of sub-Antarctic islands, especially range-restricted endemic communities, will likely suffer the greatest negative consequences of climate change. Simultaneously, ecosystem services in the Southern Ocean will likely increase. Such decoupling of ecosystem services and endemic species will require consideration in the management of human activities such as fishing in Antarctic marine ecosystems.},

We first reviewed the literature and types of data available and then developed a set of simple rules to ensure consistent use of the best available data to estimate these parameters. The method we developed estimated percent mature for the current population and the generation length for the pre-disturbance population using a simple 5- parameter demographic model based on age of first reproduction, inter-birth interval, maximum age of reproductive females, calf survival rate, and non-calf survival. When parameter estimates were not available for a species, we used available estimates from congeners. The maximum age of females was estimated based on the relationship between maximum length of females and maximum age of females for all species with data available. Generation length and percent mature were not calculated if data for the first two model parameters were unavailable for any congener (n = 29). Model-based estimates of these parameters were very close to the estimates for 6 species calculated from empirical data.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: As in many high-latitude ecosystems, euphausiids (order Euphausiacea, krill) play a key role in the Barents Sea by channeling energy from primary producers to fish and other zooplankton predators. We used multifrequency acoustic data from several recent multidisciplinary surveys to describe the spatial distribution of backscatter likely to be from euphausiids. Spatial patterns in euphausiid backscatter observed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 were correlated with vertically integrated euphausiid biomass collected with plankton nets, and were also broadly consistent with the distribution of euphausiids expected from the literature. We used the high-resolution and broad-spatial coverage of our euphausiid backscatter data to update multiple regression models of baleen (fin, humpback, and minke) whale distribution to test the hypothesis that these animals aggregated where euphausiids were abundant. After controlling for physical environmental factors and the densities of capelin and several other potential prey taxa, we found that fin whale densities were positively and linearly associated with euphausiid backscatter, and higher than average densities of humpback whales were found in areas with high euphausiid backscatter. No association was found between minke whales and euphausiids. Densities of all 3 whale species were also positively associated with capelin. For fin and humpback whales, the effects of capelin and euphausiids on whale densities appeared to be principally separate and additive, although there was some evidence for a stronger effect of euphausiids at low capelin densities. In terms of their preference for euphausiids and capelin, these whale species appeared to be flexible, opportunistic predators.},

abstract = {The tundra-taiga boundary stretches for more than 13 400 km around the Northern Hemisphere and is probably the Earth's greatest vegetation transition. The trees that define the boundary have been sensitive to climate changes in the past and models of future vegetation distribution suggest a rapid and dramatic invasion of the tundra by the taiga. Such changes would generate both positive and negative feedbacks to the climate system and the balance could result in a net warming effect. However, the, boundary is becoming increasingly affected by human activities that remove trees and degrade forest-tundra into tundra-like areas. Because of the vastness and remoteness of the tundra-taiga boundary, and of methodological problems such as problematic definitions and lack of standardized methods to record the location and characteristics of the ecotone, a project group has been established under the auspices of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). This paper summarizes the initial output of the group and focuses on our uncertainties in understanding the current processes at the tundra-taiga boundary and the conflicts between model predictions of changes in the location of the boundary and contrasting recently observed changes due to human activities. Finally, we present recommendations for a coordinated international approach to the problem and invite the international community to join us in reducing the uncertainties about the dynamics of the ecotone and their consequences.},

abstract = {Cod, harp seal and minke whale are the main top predators in the Barents Sea ecosystem. In the last decade, the abundance of cod has increased considerably, and is at a record high level. In spite of this, the growth and condition of cod has remained rather stable, although some decrease is seen in size at age of large, mature cod. During the same period, the abundance of harp seals has declined whereas the minke whale stock has been at a stable level. The body condition (blubber thickness) of these two mammal stocks has, however, decreased, with the strongest decrease observed for harp seals. A possible hypothesis for explaining this is that cod outperform the marine mammal stocks in the competition for food. The main advantages for cod are most likely larger availability of food (mainly capelin) during winter-spring than for marine mammals, as well as a wider range of prey species being available to cod than to marine mammals. Harp seals are more dependent on prey items found close to the ice edge than the other two predator stocks are, which could partly explain why the performance of harp seals is worse than that of the two other main top predators in the area.},

abstract = {In this paper, the status of ecological rehabilitation of the Dutch lowland basin of the river Rhine has been reviewed. The historical perspective, mainly with regard to river regulation measures in the past, is given. The lower river Rhine comprises a man-dominated, strongly regulated catchment, polluted water and sediments, and annihilated and deteriorated ecosystems. During the past 25 years, the water quality and, to a lesser extent, the sediment quality, has improved considerably, hence leading to improvement of biotic diversity. The rehabilitation of lost and disturbed ecosystems started some 15 years ago. The non-refutable boundary conditions for restoration projects are protection against flooding and transport by cargo ships. Holistic ecological theories to promote river catchment management are available, but the rehabilitation projects dominantly rely on local and regional planning policies. The use and application of ecological criteria are increasingly playing a role in rehabilitation schemes. Ecological rehabilitation mainly focuses on nature conservation and restoration strategies, i.e. exploiting the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic potentials of the flowing river, and introducing a semi-natural grazing regime by large herbivores. Particularly the creation of new secondary channels contributes to the restoration of riverine habitat diversity and heterogeneity, and hence to the species diversity. The assessment of a number of rehabilitation projects has led to the conclusion that no general statement can be given concerning 'success' or 'failure' of specific restoration measures. The overall balance of 14 assessed projects out of approximately 30 running projects is positive. The highly dynamic river Waal offers the best possibilities for the restoration of natural sandy levees and back swamps. It will be very difficult to rehabilitate the hardwood floodplain forests under the present management conditions. Further recovery of the river biota depends on continued decrease of pollution, an increase of morphological dynamics, and the development of the original natural habitats.},

abstract = {Some phocid seal diving-behaviour studies have identified dives characterised by a period of passive drifting through the water column, rather than active locomotion. During these "drift dives" seals are thought to preferentially direct energy towards processing of food, lactate, or renal metabolites rather than to active propulsion. We describe the first drift dives reported in an otariid, the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri (Lesson, 1828)), studied at Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Not all males in the study undertook drift dives and those that did were significantly heavier than those that did not, suggesting that body size may influence the propensity to drift dive in New Zealand fur seals. Drift dives lasted 6.0 ± 1.78 min and had passive drift segments of 3.5 ± 1.5 min, during which seals showed a negative change in depth (i.e., sinking) of 0.14 ± 0.05 m/s. Drift dives occurred at night and were possibly undertaken to avoid near-surface predators and to process food, lactate, or renal metabolites while resting. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

abstract = {Large bioacoustic archives of wild animals are an important source to identify reappearing communication patterns, which can then be related to recurring behavioral patterns to advance the current understanding of intra-specific communication of non-human animals. A main challenge remains that most large-scale bioacoustic archives contain only a small percentage of animal vocalizations and a large amount of environmental noise, which makes it extremely difficult to manually retrieve sufficient vocalizations for further analysis – particularly important for species with advanced social systems and complex vocalizations. In this study deep neural networks were trained on 11,509 killer whale (Orcinus orca) signals and 34,848 noise segments. The resulting toolkit ORCA-SPOT was tested on a large-scale bioacoustic repository – the Orchive – comprising roughly 19,000 hours of killer whale underwater recordings. An automated segmentation of the entire Orchive recordings (about 2.2 years) took approximately 8 days. It achieved a time-based precision or positive-predictive-value (PPV) of 93.2% and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9523. This approach enables an automated annotation procedure of large bioacoustics databases to extract killer whale sounds, which are essential for subsequent identification of significant communication patterns. The code will be publicly available in October 2019 to support the application of deep learning to bioaoucstic research. ORCA-SPOT can be adapted to other animal species.},

abstract = {Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae are filter feeders that use discrete lunges to effectively capture densely aggregated prey. The objective of this research was to examine how foraging humpback whales in Southeast Alaska responded to varying prey patch densities and depths. Digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs; n = 6) were deployed and focal follows were conducted on foraging whales in Sitka Sound, Alaska in September 2012. Prey density was recorded around tagged whales using a Simrad EK60 scientific echosounder and ground-truthed with net tows. Lunges were identified from peaks in jerk in the accelerometer signal, and krill were identified from echosounder data using decibel differencing. Lunge depth was 111 ± 9 m (mean ±SD) for the shallowest diving whale (foraging past sunset) and 144 ± 7 (mean ±SD) m for the deepest diving whale (foraging diurnally). Ninety-five percent of lunges occurred within a 300 m and 30 min spatio-temporal buffer of krill, indicating that tagged whales fed on krill. Generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) results for spatio-temporally integrated prey and lunge data indicated that mean volume backscattering strength, a proxy for krill density, and krill depth significantly affected the occurrence of a lunge (density: p = 0.006, depth: p < 0.001). Whales fed in the densest region of the krill layer, where mean volume backscatter was -57 dB (range: -50 to -81 dB re 1 m-1 at 120 kHz). By targeting the densest prey layer, whales maximized their energetic gain by capturing the most prey with each lunge. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2016.},

The warmth from the core of the flow was able to maintain the surface mixed layer above the freezing point, resulting in a band of reduced ice-production.

abstract = {Conservation of seabirds in remote polar regions requires accurate information on the location of breeding sites, which is often limited by logistical constraints of surveying large areas. On the Antarctic Peninsula, many seabird colonies are visited briefly but regularly by commercial cruise vessels, a platform from which we were able to collect presence/absence data on the entire community of seabirds. We used a multistate occupancy model, accounting for limited detection during surveys, to estimate the probability of presence and breeding of all 16 species native to the area. Our results provide a much clearer view than that was previously available of how avian diversity is distributed across the region's network of multi-species colonies and reveals species-specific differences in the effect of sea-ice concentration and site fidelity on breeding probability. Several breeding sites host an unusually large number of breeding species, but these known richness hotspots are scattered throughout the region and we were unable to identify any clear gradients in species richness that might explain why some sites are so species rich. While accounting for detection failure accelerates the pace of reliable inference on species occupancy, we find that as many as ten years of repeated visits are often required to fully catalog the seabird richness at bare rock sites along the Antarctic Peninsula. This work highlights the challenges of identifying high priority sites for special protection or management and the importance for continued surveys, even at nominally well-studied locations.},

abstract = {Bird migration is typically characterized by periods of flight, when fuel is consumed, and intervening stopover periods when fuel is deposited. The resulting overall migration speed can be calculated on the basis of flight speed, rate of Furl deposition and power consumption during flight. Energy deposition rate (P-dep) can be estimated as the difference between metabolic scope and field metabolic rate during stopover. Evaluating how migration speed scales with body mass yields a declining speed with increasing mass for flapping flight (proportional to m(-0.19) ), while migration speed increases with increasing mass for soaring flight. For flapping flight, migration speed and power can be calculated according to aerodynamic theory, and in soaring flight cross-country speed can be estimated from rate of climb (when circling in thermals) and the glide polar. Power in soaring gliding flight is assumed to be a constant multiple of the basal metabolic rate (BMR). We used this approach to calculate expected speeds of migration for 15 species. For a small bird with a typical energy deposition rate (P-dep = 1.0.BMR) and using flapping flight, predicted migration speed is about 200 km/day, while a maximum energy deposition rate (P-dep 2.5.BMR) yields migration speeds of 300-400 km/day. In larger birds, migration speeds wilt be lower, ranging From 70 to 100 km/day for typical energy deposition rates to 150 to 200 km:day for maximum energy deposition rates. In large species, soaring flight gives higher migration speed than flapping flight. For large species using flapping flight, migration speed per se may restrict the potential migration distance that can be accommodated within an annual breeding migration programme.},

abstract = {Recent Pan-Arctic shrub expansion has been interpreted as a response to a warmer climate. However, herbivores can also influence the abundance of shrubs in arctic ecosystems. We addressed these alternative explanations by following the changes in plant community composition during the last 10 years in permanent plots inside and outside exclosures with different mesh sizes that exclude either only reindeer or all mammalian herbivores including voles and lemmings. The exclosures were replicated at three forest and tundra sites at four different locations along a climatic gradient ( oceanic to continental) in northern Fennoscandia. Since the last 10 years have been exceptionally warm, we could study how warming has influenced the vegetation in different grazing treatments. Our results show that the abundance of the dominant shrub, Betula nana, has increased during the last decade, but that the increase was more pronounced when herbivores were excluded. Reindeer have the largest effect on shrubs in tundra, while voles and lemmings have a larger effect in the forest. The positive relationship between annual mean temperature and shrub growth in the absence of herbivores and the lack of relationships in grazed controls is another indication that shrub abundance is controlled by an interaction between herbivores and climate. In addition to their effects on taller shrubs (>0.3 m), reindeer reduced the abundance of lichens, whereas microtine rodents reduced the abundance of dwarf shrubs (<0.3 m) and mosses. In contrast to short-term responses, competitive interactions between dwarf shrubs and lichens were evident in the long term. These results show that herbivores have to be considered in order to understand how a changing climate will influence tundra ecosystems.},

abstract = {Spatial Simulation is a spatially explicit, bottom-up modelling approach that includes individual-based models and cellular automata. While spatial heterogeneity and individual variation have been considered as noise in the past, this is exactly what has become the centre of interest of the individual-based paradigm in ecology. According to Individual-based Ecology, the interaction and behaviour of individual organisms leads to the emergence of macro-level patterns on the system scale. Although individual-based models have almost always been spatially explicit, the focus was commonly given to temporal processes and behavioural rules over spatial aspects. Today, the wide availability of spatial data and ever increasing computational power together with a strive for realistic models has renewed the attention to spatial aspects in simulation modelling. This review provides an overview of the state of the art of Spatial Simulation modelling in Ecology, reviews its limitations and open issues and it discusses future research avenues by taking an explicit geospatial perspective. The main avenues that are discussed revolve around the role of spatial context to determine the structure of living systems, potentials of hybrid top-down/bottom-up model designs to integrate hierarchical, spatial and temporal scales of ecological systems, and current trends in the representation and analysis of simulated spatio-temporal (big) data.},

abstract = {Mammalian herbivores commonly alter the concentrations of secondary compounds in plants and, by this mechanism, have indirect effects on litter decomposition and soil carbon and nutrient cycling. In northernmost Fennoscandia, the subarctic mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forests are important pasture for the semidomestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). In the summer ranges, mountain birches are intensively browsed, whereas in the winter ranges, reindeer feed on ground lichens, and the mountain birches remain intact. We analyzed the effect of summer browsing on the concentrations of secondary substances, litter decomposition, and soil nutrient pools in areas that had been separated as summer or winter ranges for at least 20 years, and we predicted that summer browsing may reduce levels of secondary compounds in the mountain birch and, by this mechanism, have an indirect effect on the decomposition of mountain birch leaf litter and soil nutrient cycling. The effect of browsing on the concentration of secondary substances in the mountain birch leaves varied between different years and management districts, but in some cases, the concentration of condensed tannins was lower in the summer than in the winter ranges. In a reciprocal litter decomposition trial, both litter origin and emplacement significantly affected the litter decomposition rate. Decomposition rates were faster for the litter originating from and placed into the summer range. Soil inorganic nitrogen (N) concentrations were higher in the summer than in the winter ranges, which indicates that reindeer summer browsing may enhance the soil nutrient cycling. There was a tight inverse relationship between soil N and foliar tannin concentrations in the winter range but not in the summer range. This suggests that in these strongly nutrient-limited ecosystems, soil N availability regulates the patterns of resource allocation to condensed tannins in the absence but not in the presence of browsing.},

To eliminate this barrier, states should implement regulations for healthcare providers on how to invoke conscientious objection without jeopardizing women's access to safe, legal abortion services, especially with regard to timely referral for care and in emergency cases when referral is not possible. In addition, states should take all necessary measures to ensure that all women and adolescents have the means to prevent unintended pregnancies and to obtain safe abortion.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that seamounts hold higher abundances of some 'visiting' animals, such as tuna, sharks, billfishes, marine mammals, sea-turtles and even seabirds, but this has been based on sparse records, and warrants further examination. In this paper we use data from a fishery observer program to examine whether the predicted higher abundances of tuna, marine mammals, sea turtles and seabirds actually occur around Azores seamounts and to map the distribution of the various species. Our results indicate that some marine predators (skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis and bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, common dolphin Delphinus delphis and Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea borealis) were significantly more abundant in the vicinity of some shallowwater seamount summits. Our methodology, however, failed to demonstrate a seamount association for bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus, spotted dolphin Stenella frontalis, sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, terns Sterna hirundo and S. dougalli, yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans atlantis and loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta. Seamounts may act as feeding stations for some of these visitors. Not all seamounts, however, seemed to be equally important for these associations. Only seamounts shallower than 400 m depth showed significant aggregation effects. These seamounts may be considered hotspots of marine life in the Azores, and a special effort should be made in order to ensure a sustainable management of these habitats.},

During the animals' migration the CTD-SRDLs recorded and transmitted hydrographic profiles at a rate of approximately two profiles per day to an average depth of about 547 m, representing transect-type sections with a spatial resolution of 16-47 km along the migratory routes of the seals. Two sections are used to clearly identify the locations of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts across Drake Passage, providing in situ data complementary to satellite and other techniques. An empirical relationship between upper ocean temperature and baroclinic mass transport is used to determine the transport through Drake Passage at the times of the sections, and these transports are compared with estimates derived by other techniques. An absolute geostrophic velocity section across Drake Passage is calculated using CTD-SRDL data and data of absolute geostrophic surface velocities from altimetry. The mean total baroclinic transports in June 2004 and April 2005 are estimated to be 124 X 10(6) +/- 14 X 10(6) m(3) s(-1) and 112 X 10(6) +/- 14 X 10(6) m(3) s(-1) respectively.},

Twenty one of these CTD-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs) were attached to Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) on South Georgia. The merged data yield unified gridded hydrogaphic fields with high temporal and spatial resolution, enabling the determination of features absent in each of the data sets separately. The structure and variability of the frontal field revealed by this data set were compared with those in daily quarter-degree, optimally interpolated sea surface temperature fields and fields of weekly gridded sea level anomaly. In general, the frontal positions derived using our data set are in agreement with previous work, especially where the pathways are constrained by topography, e. g., at the North Scotia Ridge and the South Scotia Ridge. However, with the improved temporal and spacial resolution provided by the CTD-SRDLs, we were able to observe some novel features. All frontal positions are more variable than previously indicated across the Scotia Sea and west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on seasonal time scales. The merged data set shows the temporal variability of the Southern ACC Front (SACCF) north of South Georgia and in its position east of the island, where the SACCF lies further north than has been suggested in previous work. In addition, the Subantarctic Front crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge about 400 km further north when compared to previous work.},

abstract = {Global warming drives changes in oceanographic conditions in the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent continental slopes. This may result in favourable conditions for increased biological production in waters at the northern continental shelves. However, production in the central Arctic Ocean will continue to be limited by the amount of light and by vertical stratification reducing nutrient availability. Upwelling conditions due to topography and inflowing warm and nutrient rich Atlantic Water may result in high production in areas along the shelf breaks. This may particularly influence distribution and abundance of sea mammals, as can be seen from analysis of historical records of hunting. The species composition and biomass of plankton, fish and shellfish may be influenced by acidification due to increased carbon dioxide uptake in the water, thereby reducing the survival of some species. Northwards shift in the distribution of commercial species of fish and shellfish is observed in the Barents Sea, especially in the summer period, and is related to increased inflow of Atlantic Water and reduced ice cover. This implies a northward extension of boreal species and potential displacement of lipid-rich Arctic zooplankton, altering the distribution of organisms that depend on such prey. However, euphausiid stocks expanding northward into the Arctic Ocean may be a valuable food resource as they may benefit from increases in Arctic phytoplankton production and rising water temperatures. Even though no scenario modelling or other prediction analyses have been made, both scientific ecosystem surveys in the northern areas, as well as the fisheries show indications of a recent northern expansion of mackerel (Scomber scombrus), cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). These stocks are found as far north as the shelf-break north of Svalbard. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), redfish (Sebastes spp.) and shrimp (Pandalus borealis) are also present in the slope waters between the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. It is assumed that cod and haddock have reached their northernmost limit, whereas capelin and redfish have potential to expand their distribution further into the Arctic Ocean. Common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) may also be able to expand their distribution into the Arctic Ocean. The abundance and distribution of other species may change as well – to what degree is unknown.},

abstract = {Animal behaviour can provide valuable information for wildlife management and conservation. Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of abundance are imperative for successful conservation and management. Classical, stratified abundance estimators provide unbiased estimates of abundance, but such estimators may be imprecise and impede assessment of population status and trend when the distribution of individuals is highly variable in space. Model-based procedures that account for important environmental covariates can improve overall precision, but frequently there is uncertainty about the contribution of particular environmental variables and a lack of information about variables that are important determinants of abundance. We develop a general semiparametric mixture model that incorporates measured habitat variables and a non-parametric smoothing term to account for unmeasured variables. We contrast this spatial habitat approach with two stratified abundance estimators and compare the three models using an intensively managed marine fish, darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri). We show that the spatial habitat model yields more precise, biologically reasonable, and interpretable estimates of abundance than the classical methods. Our results suggest that while design-based estimators are unbiased, they may exaggerate temporal variability of populations and strongly influence inference about population trend. Furthermore, when such estimates are used in broader meta-analyses, such imprecision may affect the broader biological inference (e.g., the causes and conse-quences of the variability of populations). R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} : Des estimations exactes de l'abondance sont essentielles au succ{\`{e}}s de la conservation et de la gestion. Si les estimateurs d'abondance stratifi{\'{e}}s classiques fournissent des estimations non biais{\'{e}}es de l'abondance, ces estimateurs peuvent {\^{e}}tre impr{\'{e}}cis ou entraver l'{\'{e}}valuation de l'{\'{e}}tat et de la tendance de la population si la r{\'{e}}partition des individus est tr{\`{e}}s variable dans l'espace. Si des proc{\'{e}}dures bas{\'{e}}es sur des mod{\`{e}}les qui tiennent compte d'importantes covariables environnementales peuvent am{\'{e}}liorer la pr{\'{e}}cision globale, il y a souvent une incertitude associ{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} la contribution de diff{\'{e}}rentes variables environnementales et un manque d'information sur les variables qui sont d'importants d{\'{e}}terminants de l'abondance. Nous avons d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}} un mod{\`{e}}le de m{\'{e}}lange semi-param{\'{e}}trique g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral qui incorpore des variables mesur{\'{e}}es de l'habitat et un terme de lissage non param{\'{e}}-trique pour tenir compte des variables non mesur{\'{e}}es.

abstract = {Cultural transmission of behaviour is important in a wide variety of vertebrate taxa from birds to humans. Vocal traditions and vocal learning provide a strong foundation for studying culture and its transmission in both humans and cetaceans. Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform complex, culturally transmitted song displays that can change both evolutionarily (through accumulations of small changes) or revolutionarily (where a population rapidly adopts a novel song). The degree of coordination and conformity underlying song revolutions makes their study of particular interest. Acoustic contact on migratory routes may provide a mechanism for cultural revolutions of song, yet these areas of contact remain uncertain. Here, we compared songs recorded from the Kermadec Islands, a recently discovered migratory stopover, to multiple South Pacific wintering grounds. Similarities in song themes from the Kermadec Islands and multiple wintering locations (from New Caledonia across to the Cook Islands) suggest a location allowing cultural transmission of song eastward across the South Pacific, active song learning (hybrid songs) and the potential for cultural convergence after acoustic isolation at the wintering grounds. As with the correlations in humans between genes, communication and migration, the migration patterns of humpback whales are written into their songs.},

abstract = {Studies in model organisms constitute the basis of our understanding of the principal molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination in the developing central nervous system. Considering the emergent applications in stem cell-based regenerative medicine, it is important to demonstrate conservation of subtype specific gene expression programs in human as compared to model vertebrates. We have examined the expression patterns of key regulatory genes in neural progenitor cells and their neuronal and glial descendants in the developing human spinal cord, hindbrain, and midbrain, and compared these with developing mouse and chicken embryos. As anticipated, gene expression patterns are highly conserved between these vertebrate species, but there are also features that appear unique to human development. In particular, we find that neither tyrosine hydroxylase nor Nurr1 are specific markers for mesencephalic dopamine neurons, as these genes also are expressed in other neuronal subtypes in the human ventral midbrain and in human embryonic stem cell cultures directed to differentiate towards a ventral mesencephalic identity. Moreover, somatic motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord appear to be produced by two molecularly distinct ventral progenitor populations in the human, raising the possibility that the acquisition of unique ventral progenitor identities may have contributed to the emergence of neural subtypes in higher vertebrates.},

abstract = {The study focuses on vegetation changes in the Nordic mountain birch forest in northern Norway, covering a period of more than 40 yr. The study area comprises the municipalities of Kautokeino and Karasjok on Finnmarkskvidda; it is predominantly covered by lichen and dwarf shrub vegetation. Sizes of various vegetation classes were estimated by the use of remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys. A significant change in vegetation cover during the study period was registered in the whole study area. Vegetation types dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia fleuxuosa), the dwarf cornel (Cornus suecica), and mosses have tripled in abundance compared to 40 yr ago. In contrast, lichen-dominated heaths and woodland (forests), preferred by the reindeer stocks intensively utilizing these areas of Finnmarksvidda, have decreased by approximately 80% in abundance during the same period. Correspondingly, there has been a significant increase in the extent of birch forests especially in Kautokeino (90% increase). The reason for the steep decline in lichen-dominated areas appears to be a direct consequence of the intensive grazing by the increasing reindeer population in the period 1961-1987, but climate change (increased precipitation), caterpillar attacks, and long-transported air pollution (e.g., nitrogen) may also have accentuated the increase of forests and other vegetation types.},

The comparison of a mosaic of two aerial photographs from 1957 (137 km 2 ) and one satellite image taken in 2008 (151 km 2 ) revealed that both hilltops and terraces recorded an increase in shrub cover. However, the increase was significantly greater on terraces than on hilltops (21.6% versus 11.6%). According to ground truthing, the shrub cover densification is associated mainly with an increase of Betula glandulosa Michx. The numerous seedlings observed during the ground truthing suggest that shrub densification should continue in the future.},

abstract = {Question: The optimal use of the point intercept method (PIM) for efficient estimation of plant biomass has not been addressed although PIM is a commonly used method in vegetation analysis. In this study we compare results achieved using PIM at a range of efforts, we assess a method for calculating these results that are new with PIM and we provide a formula for planning the optimal use of PIM. Location: Northern Norway. Methods: We collected intercept data at a range of efforts, i.e. from one to 100 pins per 0.25 m(2) plots, on three plant growth forms in a mountain meadow. After collection of intercept data we clipped and weighed the plant biomass. The relationship between intercept frequency and weighed biomass (b) was estimated using both a weighted linear regression model (WLR) and an ordinary linear regression model (OLR). The accuracy of the estimate of biomass achieved by PIM at different efforts was assessed by running computer simulations at different pin densities. Results: The relationship between intercept frequency and weighed biomass (b) was far better estimated using WLR compared to the normally used OLR. Efforts above 10 pins per 0.25 m(2) lot had a negligible effect on the accuracy of the estimate of biomass achieved by PIM whereas the number of plots had a strong effect. Moreover, for a given level of accuracy, the required number of plots varied depending on plant growth form. We achieved similar results to that of the computer simulations when applying our WLR based formula. Conclusion: This study shows that PIM can be applied more efficiently than was done in previous studies for the purpose of plant biomass estimation, where several plots should be analysed but at considerably less effort per plot. Moreover, WLR rather than OLR should be applied when estimating biomass from intercept frequency. The formula we have deduced is a useful tool for planning plant biomass analysis with PIM.},

abstract = {<p>Hauling out is an essential component of pinniped life-history. Haul-out behaviour may be affected by biological (e.g. sex, age and condition) and physical factors (e.g. food availability and environmental conditions), and identifying these factors may help explain the spatio-temporal distribution and habitat use of pinnipeds. The aim of this study is to describe observed winter haul-out patterns of adult Weddell seals in the Weddell Sea and investigate the role of potential predictors to gain insight into the way these animals interact with the physical environment in this region. We examined the haul-out behaviour in relation to available biological (i.e., diving effort, sex) and physical information (i.e., sun angle). Thirty-three satellite telemetry tags were deployed on adult Weddell seals in the southern Weddell Sea during February 2007, 2009 and 2011, following their annual moult recording information on the behavioural mode of the animal: at surface, hauled out or diving. At the end of the austral summer Weddell seals spent, on average, more than 40% of their time hauled out on the ice. Under constant light conditions, it appears that physiological factors drive sex differences in the timing and duration of haul-out behaviour, with females spending on average more time hauled out than males during daylight hours. This time spent hauled-out declined to around 15% in both sexes by the beginning of autumn and remained at this level with a clear nocturnal haul-out pattern during the winter. The time spent diving increased during this period, indicating an increase in foraging effort during the winter months, and led to a common haul-out pattern in both sexes over winter. We found a positive relationship between haul-out duration and the percentage of time spent diving prior to a haul-out in both sexes, with the exception of female daytime haul-outs early in the year.</p>},

abstract = {The abundances of large whale species are presented for the northeast Atlantic from near-complete survey coverage in 1995 and from multiple partial-area surveys during 1996-2001. These Norwegian shipboard surveys were generally conducted with 2 independent observer platforms, except for single-platform surveys during part of 1995. Tracking procedures implemented for minke whales – Balaenoptera acutorostrata (the target species) meant that the surveys had to be conducted in passing mode, and there were therefore only limited opportunities for closing on sightings to determine species identity and school size. Abundance estimates for large whale species (fin – Balaenoptera physalus, humpback – Megaptera novaeangliae and sperm whales – Physeter macrocephalus) were obtained by combining sightings from both platforms, and applying standard distance sampling techniques to the smeared and truncated perpendicular distances for each species. Abundance estimates for the 2 survey groupings (1995 and 1996-2001) summarised over comparable areas were: fin whales, 5,034 (cv 0.209) and 6,409 (cv 0.18); humpback whales, 1,059 (cv 0.248) and 1,450 (cv 0.29); and sperm whales, 4,319 (cv 0.199) and 6,207 (cv 0.22). The estimated cv's are likely underestimates and specifically the combined partial-area survey cv's do not include additional variance due to possible distributional shifts between years. Inclusion of a new survey stratum north of Iceland (block NVS) in the later set of surveys revealed a high additional abundance there of fin whales 3,960 (cv 0.538) and humpback whales 3,246 (cv 0.512). The high humpback whale estimate for this stratum confirms the Icelandic survey findings of a large humpback whale population summering in that area.},

abstract = {<p>Global wind patterns influence dispersal and migration processes of aerial organisms, propagules and particles, which ultimately could determine the dynamics of colonizations, invasions or spread of pathogens. However, studying how wind-mediated movements actually happen has been hampered so far by the lack of high resolution global wind data as well as the impossibility to track aerial movements. Using concurrent data on winds and actual pathways of a tracked seabird, here we show that oceanic winds define spatiotemporal pathways and barriers for large-scale aerial movements. We obtained wind data from NASA SeaWinds scatterometer to calculate wind cost (impedance) models reflecting the resistance to the aerial movement near the ocean surface. We also tracked the movements of a model organism, the Cory's shearwater (<italic>Calonectris diomedea</italic>), a pelagic bird known to perform long distance migrations. Cost models revealed that distant areas can be connected through {\^{a}}€{\oe}wind highways{\^{a}}€  that do not match the shortest great circle routes. Bird routes closely followed the low-cost {\^{a}}€{\oe}wind-highways{\^{a}}€  linking breeding and wintering areas. In addition, we found that a potential barrier, the near surface westerlies in the Atlantic sector of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), temporally hindered meridional trans-equatorial movements. Once the westerlies vanished, birds crossed the ITCZ to their winter quarters. This study provides a novel approach to investigate wind-mediated movements in oceanic environments and shows that large-scale migration and dispersal processes over the oceans can be largely driven by spatiotemporal wind patterns.</p>},

abstract = {In recent years, the international Southern Elephant seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) project has deployed miniaturized conductivity-temperature-depth satellite-relayed data loggers (CTD-SRDL) on elephant seals 1) to study their winter foraging ecology in relation to oceanographic conditions, and 2) to collect hydrographic data from polar regions, which are otherwise sparsely sampled. We summarize here the main results that have been published in both science components since 2003/2004. Instrumented southern elephant seals visit different regions within the Southern Ocean (frontal zones, continental shelf, and/or ice covered areas) and forage in a variety of different water masses (e.g. Circumpolar Deep Water upwelling regions, High Salinity Shelf Water), depending on their geographic distribution. Adult females and juvenile males from Kerguelen Is. forage pelagically in frontal zones of the Southern Indian Ocean, while adult males forage benthically over the Kerguelen Plateau and the Antarctic Continental Shelf, with the two groups feeding at different trophic levels as shown by stable isotopes analysis. Oceanographic studies using the data collected from the seals have, to date, concentrated on circumpolar and regional studies of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) circulation. The temperature and salinity profiles documented by elephant seals at high latitudes, including below sea ice, have permitted quasi-circumpolar mapping of the southernmost fronts of the ACC. By merging conventional data and the high temporal and spatial resolution data collected by seal-borne SRDLs, it has been possible to describe precisely 1) the large-scale features of the ACC in the South Atlantic and its variability; 2) the circulation pattern over the Kerguelen plateau, revealing that the poorly known Fawn Trough concentrates an important proportion of the ACC flow in that region. Seals that foraged in ice covered areas have made eulerian time series available that have allowed for the estimation of sea ice formation rates, a parameter that is otherwise difficult to obtain, while also providing a unique description of the wintertime ocean circulation over the central Weddell Sea continental shelf. Finally, we present the first data collected by a newly-developed fluorescence sensor that has been embedded in the regular CTD-SRDL and deployed on elephant seals at Kerguelen. The fluorometer data obtained have offered the first synoptic view of the 3 dimensional distribution of temperature, salinity and fluorescence over a vast sector of the Southern Indian Ocean, allowing us to describe both vertical and horizontal variations in chlorophyll. This paper will make a core contribution to the Plenary Sessions 2C, 3A and 4A, and will be relevant to 2A and 2B},

abstract = {Selective foraging by moose on hardwoods and avoidance of conifers alters community composition and structure, which in turn can affect nutrient cycles and productivity. The effect of moose browsing on the nutrient cycles of boreal forests was studied using three 40-yr-old exclosures on Isle Royale, Michigan. Two alternative mechanisms by which moose affect ecosystems were tested: (1) moose depress both the quantity and quality of litter return to the soil, and hence N mineralization and net primary productivity, by browsing on hardwoods and avoiding conifers; (2) moose stimulate N mineralization, and hence net primary productivity, by opening the canopy and by dropping fecal pellets. Soil nutrient availability and microbial activity, including exchangeable cations, total carbon and nitrogen, nitrogen mineralization rates, and microbial respiration rates, were uniformly higher in exclosures than outside. These differences were more significant where browsing intensity was high and less often significant where browsing intensity was low. N mineralization in browsed plots declined with increasing moose consumption rates. Net primary production in exclosures and browsed plots was strongly correlated with N mineralization. N mineralization in turn was positively correlated with litter N return and negatively correlated with litter cellulose content. These differences in litter quantity and quality were caused by an increased abundance of unbrowsed spruce outside the exclosures. Moose pellets alone mineralized less N but more C than soil alone, but pellets combined with soil stimulated N and C mineralization more than the sum of the two separately. However, this did not appear to be sufficient to offset the depression in nitrogen and carbon mineralization in soil resulting from the increased abundance of unbrowsed spruce. We conclude that, in the long term, high rates of moose browsing depress N mineralization and net primary production through the indirect effects on recruitment into the tree stratum, and subsequent depression of litter N return and litter quality. These results suggest that the effects of herbivores on ecosystems may be amplified by positive feedbacks between plant litter and soil nutrient availability.},

abstract = {High-latitude regions are experiencing substantial climate change, and the forest-tundra transition is assumed to sensitively track these changes through advancing treeline and increased tundra encroachment. However, herbivores may influence these responses. The present study addresses, through analyses of age structures, growth characteristics, and climate correspondence, how mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Hamet-Ahti) treelines and sapling cohorts beyond the treeline have responded to the last decade's warming in six North European subarctic areas with different climate and grazing characters. The results show different response patterns among areas representing advancing, stationary, and possibly retreating treelines. Recruitment was abundant over the last decades in all areas except one, with predominantly arctic conditions, where both tree and sapling cohorts were old. Areas with high annual precipitation show advancing birch populations characterized by young individuals and partly overlapping tree and sapling age distributions. Areas in reindeer herding districts show stationary or retreating birch populations characterized by nonoverlapping age distributions and low sapling survival. Recruitment patterns beyond the treeline generally corresponded with non-growing-season climate variables, mainly precipitation, indicating the importance of a protecting snow cover. The results highlight the important interplay between abiotic and biotic control over tundra encroachment and treeline dynamics and the importance of multisite studies when addressing responses to warming.},

abstract = {For diving animals, animal-borne sensors are used to collect time-depth information for studying behaviour, ranging patterns and foraging ecology. Often, this information needs to be compressed for storage or transmission. Widely used devices called conductivity-temperature-depth satellite relay data loggers (CTD-SRDLs) sample time and depth at high resolution during a dive and then abstract the time-depth trajectory using a broken-stick model (BSM). This approximation method can summarize efficiently the curvilinear shape of a dive, using a piecewise linear shape with a small, fixed number of vertices, or break points. We present the process of abstracting dives using the BSM and quantify its performance, by measuring the uncertainty associated with the profiles it produces. We develop a method for obtaining a confidence zone and an index for the goodness-of-fit (dive zone index, DZI) for abstracted dive profiles. We validate our results with a case study using dives from elephant seals (Mirounga spp.). We use generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine whether the DZI can be used as a proxy for an absolute measure of fit and investigate the relationship between the DZI and the dive shape. We found a strong correlation between the residual sum of squares (RSS) for the difference between the detailed and abstracted profiles, and the DZI and maximum residual (R4), for dives resulting from CTD-SRDLs (69% deviance explained). On its own, the DZI explained a lower percentage of deviance which was variable for abstracted dives with different numbers of break points. We also found evidence for systematic differences in the DZI for different dive shapes (65% deviance explained). Although the proportional loss of information in the abstraction of time-depth dive profiles by BSM is high, what remains is sufficient to infer goodness-of-fit of the abstracted profile by reversing the abstraction process. Our results suggest that together the DZI and R4 can be used as a proxy for the RSS, and we present the method for obtaining these metrics for BSM-abstracted profiles.},

As the smallest obligate lunge filter feeders, minke whales represent an ideal system for studying the physical and energetic limits of filter feeding in endotherms. We used multi-sensor suction cup tags to quantify the feeding performance of Antarctic minke whales. Foraging dives around and beneath sea ice contained up to 24 lunges per dive, the highest feeding rates for any lunge-feeding whale. Their small size allows minke whales access to krill in sea-ice environments not easily accessible to larger baleen whales. Furthermore, their ability to filter feed provides an advantage over other smaller sympatric krill predators such as penguins and seals that feed on individual prey. The unique combination of body size, feeding mechanism and sea-ice habitat of Antarctic minke whales defines a previously undocumented energetic niche that is unique among aquatic vertebrates.},

abstract = {Aim Describe the spatial and temporal properties of transitions in the Arctic and develop a conceptual understanding of the nature of these spatial transitions in the face of directional environmental change. Location Arctic tundra ecosystems of the North Slope of Alaska and the tundra-forest region of the Seward Peninsula, Alaska Methods We synthesize information from numerous studies on tundra and treeline ecosystems in an effort to document the spatial changes that occur across four arctic transitions. These transitions are: (i) the transition between High-Arctic and Low-Arctic systems, (ii) the transition between moist non-acidic tundra (MNT) and moist acidic tundra (MAT, also referred to as tussock tundra), (iii) the transition between tussock tundra and shrub tundra, (iv) the transition between tundra and forested systems. By documenting the nature of these spatial transitions, in terms of their environmental controls and vegetation patterns, we develop a conceptual model of temporal dynamics of arctic ecotones in response to environmental change. Results Our observations suggest that each transition is sensitive to a unique combination of controlling factors. The transition between High and Low Arctic is sensitive primarily to climate, whereas the MNT/MAT transition is also controlled by soil parent material, permafrost and hydrology. The tussock/shrub tundra transition appears to be responsive to several factors, including climate, topography and hydrology. Finally, the tundra/forest boundary responds primarily to climate and to climatically associated changes in permafrost. There were also important differences in the demography and distribution of the dominant plant species across the four vegetation transitions. The shrubs that characterize the tussock/shrub transition can achieve dominance potentially within a decade, whereas spruce trees often require several decades to centuries to achieve dominance within tundra, and Sphagnum moss colonization of non-acidic sites at the MNT/MAT boundary may require centuries to millennia of soil development. Main conclusions We suggest that vegetation will respond most rapidly to climatic change when (i) the vegetation transition correlates more strongly with climate than with other environmental variables, (ii) dominant species exhibit gradual changes in abundance across spatial transitions, and/or (iii) the dominant species have demographic properties that allow rapid increases in abundance following climatic shifts. All three of these properties characterize the transition between tussock tundra and low shrub tundra. It is therefore not surprising that of the four transitions studied this is the one that appears to be responding most rapidly to climatic warming.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous usage of space by individual animals or animal populations is partly due to their preference for particular resources that are, themselves. heterogeneously distributed. When all points in the environment are equally accessible, a direct relationship between usage and preference can be assumed. However, when accessibility is restricted, spatial variations in usage can no longer be attributed entirely to preference. In such cases, it is necessary to control for the effects of accessibility on observed usage before conclusions about preference can be drawn. In this paper, I develop a modelling framework that treats the use of space by animals as a joint function of preference and accessibility. I specify a null version of the framework that assumes no preference and propose that its output can be used to control for the effect of accessibility on the observed, spatial distribution of usage. I briefly discuss how the framework can subsequently be used to provide insights about the animals' preference for different resources and types of movement, and to predict usage in areas where no usage data exist. I explore the properties of the methodology using data from a population of simulated animals and present the first results of its application to a sub-set of the British population of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus).

Most dives for adult seals (97{%}) were shorter than 10{\thinspace}min. Young pups performed dives that were shallower and shorter in duration than their accompanying mothers, but diving skills improved rapidly with age. Six of the seven pups dived deeper than 448{\thinspace}m by the time they were 2{\thinspace}months old.

abstract = {Age is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology, but is difficult to determine in many species. Humpback whales exemplify this as they have a lifespan comparable to humans, mature sexually as early as 4 years and have no reliable visual age indicators after their first year. Current methods for estimating humpback age cannot be applied to all individuals and populations. Assays for human age have recently been developed based on age-induced changes in DNA methylation of specific genes. We used information on age-associated DNA methylation in human and mouse genes to identify homologous gene regions in humpbacks. Humpback skin samples were obtained from individuals with a known year of birth and employed to calibrate relationships between cytosine methylation and age. Seven of 37 cytosines assayed for methylation level in humpback skin had significant age-related profiles. The three most age-informative cytosine markers were selected for a humpback epigenetic age assay. The assay has an R(2) of 0.787 (P = 3.04e-16) and predicts age from skin samples with a standard deviation of 2.991 years. The epigenetic method correctly determined which of parent-offspring pairs is the parent in more than 93% of cases. To demonstrate the potential of this technique, we constructed the first modern age profile of humpback whales off eastern Australia and compared the results to population structure 5 decades earlier. This is the first epigenetic age estimation method for a wild animal species and the approach we took for developing it can be applied to many other nonmodel organisms.},

abstract = {Reports of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song chorusing occurring outside the breeding grounds are becoming more common, but song structure and underwater behavior of individual singers on feeding grounds and migration routes remain unknown. Here, ten humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were tagged in May 2010 with non-invasive, suction-cup attached tags to study foraging ecology and acoustic behavior. Background song was identified on all ten records, but additionally, acoustic records of two whales showed intense and continuous singing, with a level of organization and structure approaching that of typical breeding ground song. The songs, produced either by the tagged animals or close associates, shared phrase types and theme structure with one another, and some song bouts lasted close to an hour. Dive behavior of tagged animals during the time of sound production showed song occurring during periods of active diving, sometimes to depths greater than 100 m. One tag record also contained song in the presence of feeding lunges identified from the behavioral sensors, indicating that mating displays occur in areas worthy of foraging. These data show behavioral flexibility as the humpbacks manage competing needs to continue to feed and to prepare for the breeding season during late fall. This may also signify an ability to engage in breeding activities outside of the traditional, warm water breeding ground locations.},

abstract = {Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in logger-equipped animals, with researchers summing the acceleration (overall dynamic body acceleration--ODBA) from the three orthogonal axes of devices. The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P<0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in VO2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P<0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more 'correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for VO2. In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for VO2.},

abstract = {For the first time bio-logging tags were attached to free-ranging white-beaked dolphins, Lagenorhynchus albirostris. A satellite tag was attached to one animal while an acoustic A-tag, a time-depth recorder and a VHF transmitter complex was attached to a second dolphin with a suction cup. The satellite tag transmitted for 201 day, during which time the dolphin stayed in the coastal waters of western Iceland. The acoustic tag complex was on the second animal for 13. h and 40. min and provided the first insight into the echolocation behaviour of a free-ranging white-beaked dolphin. The tag registered 162 dives. The dolphin dove to a maximum depth of 45. m, which is about the depth of the bay in which the dolphin was swimming. Two basic types of dives were identified; U-shaped and V-shaped dives. The dolphin used more time in U-shaped dives, more clicks and sonar signals with shorter click intervals compared to those it used in V-shaped dives. The dolphin was in acoustic contact with other dolphins about five hours after it was released and stayed with these for the rest of the tagging time. Possible foraging attempts were found based on the reduction of click intervals from about 100. ms to 2-3. ms, which suggests a prey capture attempt. We found 19 punitive prey capture attempts and of these 53% occurred at the maximum dive depth. This suggests that more than half of the possible prey capture events occurred at or near the sea bed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many diving animals undergo substantial changes in their body density that are the result of changes in lipid content over their annual fasting cycle. Because the size of the lipid stores reflects an integration of foraging effort (energy expenditure) and foraging success (energy assimilation), measuring body density is a good way to track net resource acquisition of free-ranging animals while at sea. Here, we experimentally altered the body density and mass of three free-ranging elephant seals by remotely detaching weights and floats while monitoring their swimming speed, depth and three-axis acceleration with a high-resolution data logger. Cross-validation of three methods for estimating body density from hydrodynamic gliding performance of freely diving animals showed strong positive correlation with body density estimates obtained from isotope dilution body composition analysis over density ranges of 1015 to 1060 kg m(-3). All three hydrodynamic models were within 1% of, but slightly greater than, body density measurements determined by isotope dilution, and therefore have the potential to track changes in body condition of a wide range of freely diving animals. Gliding during ascent and descent clearly increased and stroke rate decreased when buoyancy manipulations aided the direction of vertical transit, but ascent and descent speed were largely unchanged. The seals adjusted stroking intensity to maintain swim speed within a narrow range, despite changes in buoyancy. During active swimming, all three seals increased the amplitude of lateral body accelerations and two of the seals altered stroke frequency in response to the need to produce thrust required to overcome combined drag and buoyancy forces.},

A class of multisensor, suction-cup-attached archival tags has revolutionized the study of large baleen whales, particularly with respect to the predatory strategies used by these gigantic bulk filter feeders to exploit abundant oceanic resources. By integrating these data with those from other disciplines, researchers have uncovered a diverse and extraordinary set of underwater behaviors, ranging from acrobatic diving maneuvers to extreme feeding events during which whales engulf volumes of prey-laden water that are much larger than their own body. This research framework not only improves our knowledge of the individual performance and behavior of these keystone predators but also informs our ability to understand the dynamics of complex marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) present a complex mixture of congeners which are often analysed and assessed as short-, medium- and long-chain CPs, i.e. $\Sigma$SCCP (C10–C13), $\Sigma$MCCP (C14–C17) and $\Sigma$LCCP (≥C18). Their complexity makes the chemical analysis challenging, in particular in terms of accurate quantification, but promising developments involving ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry have been presented lately. Most Arctic data exist for SCCPs, while LCCPs have not yet been studied in the Arctic. $\Sigma$SCCP concentrations in Arctic air often exceeded those of $\Sigma$MCCP, usually with a predominance of the most volatile C10 congeners, and of banned persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The presence of SCCPs and MCCPs in Arctic air, as well as in the Antarctic and in the remote regions of the Tibetan plateau, provides evidence of their long-range transport including sufficient environmental persistence to reach the Arctic. Arctic vegetation accumulated SCCPs partly from air and partly through root uptake from soil, with consequences for the SCCP profile found in Arctic plants. No results have yet been reported for CPs in terrestrial Arctic animals. Results for freshwater sediment and fish confirmed the long-range transport of SCCPs and MCCPs and documented their bioaccumulation. Where additional PCB data were available, $\Sigma$PCB was usually higher than $\Sigma$SCCP in freshwater fish. Both SCCPs and MCCPs were widely present in marine Arctic biota (e.g. mussels, fish, seabirds, seals, whales, polar bears). In mussels and Atlantic cod, $\Sigma$MCCP concentrations exceeded those of $\Sigma$SCCP, while this was less clear for other marine species. Marine mammals and the long-lived Greenland shark roughly had $\Sigma$SCCP concentrations of 100–500 ng/g lipid weight, often dominated by C11 congeners. Biomagnification appeared to be more pronounced for $\Sigma$SCCP than for $\Sigma$MCCP, but more studies will be needed. Increasing $\Sigma$SCCP concentrations were observed in Arctic air and sediment over time, but not in beluga monitored since the 1980s. For both SCCPs and MCCPs, increasing concentrations over time have been shown in blue mussels and Atlantic cod at some, but not all stations. Indications exist of local sources of SCCPs in the Arctic, including Arctic settlements and research stations. In studies involving multiple locations, a general decrease of SCCP concentrations with increasing latitude or distance from point sources was observed as well as relatively more MCCPs at locations closer to potential CP sources. Monitoring of SCCPs and MCCPs has been initiated in some Arctic regions and will be important to assess the effect of recent regulations of SCCPs and the use of potential replacement chemicals.},

abstract = {In the last thirty years, the emergence and progression of biologging technology has led to great advances in marine predator ecology. Large databases of location and dive observations from biologging devices have been compiled for an increasing number of diving predator species (such as pinnipeds, sea turtles, seabirds and cetaceans), enabling complex questions about animal activity budgets and habitat use to be addressed. Central to answering these questions is our ability to correctly identify and quantify the frequency of essential behaviours, such as foraging. Despite technological advances that have increased the quality and resolution of location and dive data, accurately interpreting behaviour from such data remains a challenge, and analytical methods are only beginning to unlock the full potential of existing datasets. This review evaluates both traditional and emerging methods and presents a starting platform of options for future studies of marine predator foraging ecology, particularly from location and two-dimensional (time-depth) dive data. We outline the different devices and data types available, discuss the limitations and advantages of commonly-used analytical techniques, and highlight key areas for future research. We focus our review on pinnipeds -one of the most studied taxa of marine predators -but offer insights that will be applicable to other air-breathing marine predator tracking studies. We highlight that traditionally-used methods for inferring foraging from location and dive data, such as first-passage time and dive shape analysis, have important caveats and limitations depending on the nature of the data and the research question. We suggest that more holistic statistical techniques, such as state-space models, which can synthesise multiple track, dive and environmental metrics whilst simultaneously accounting for measurement error, offer more robust alternatives. Finally, we identify a need for more research to elucidate the role of physical oceanography, device effects, study animal selection, and developmental stages in predator behaviour and data interpretation.},

We measured polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers in fat, and perfluoroalkyl substances in plasma in pelagic and coastal adult female polar bears with similar body condition. We studied polar bear feeding habits with bulk stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. Nitrogen isotopes of amino acids were used to investigate their trophic position. We studied energy expenditure by estimating field metabolic rate using telemetry data. Annual home range size was determined, and spatial gradients in pollutants were explored using latitude and longitude centroid positions of polar bears. Pollutant levels were measured in harp seals from the Greenland Sea and White Sea-Barents Sea as a proxy for a West-East gradient of pollutants in polar bear prey. We showed that pelagic bears had higher pollutant loads than coastal bears because (1) they feed on a higher proportion of marine and higher trophic level prey, (2) they have higher energy requirements and higher prey consumption, (3) they forage in the marginal ice zones, and (4) they feed on prey located closer to pollutant emission sources/transport pathways.},

abstract = {Southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, undertake large-scale oceanic movements to access favourable foraging areas. Successful foraging areas of elephant seals from the Kerguelen Islands are investigated here in relation to oceanographic parameters. Movements and diving activity of the seals as well as oceanographic data were collected through a new generation of satellite relayed devices measuring and transmitting locations, pressure, temperature and salinity. For the first time, we have associated foraging behaviour, determined by high increased sinuosity in tracks, and dive density (i.e. number of dives performed per kilometre covered), and changes in body condition, determined by variations in drift rate obtained from drift dives, to identify the oceanographic conditions of successful foraging zones for this species. Two main sectors, one close to the Antarctic continent and the other along the Polar Front (PF), where both foraging activity and body condition increase, seem to be of particular interest for the seals. Within these regions, some seals tended to focus their foraging activity on zones with particular temperature signatures. Along the Antarctic continent, some seals targeted colder waters on the sea bottom during benthic dives, while at the PF the favourable zones tended to be warmer. The possible negative effect of colder waters in Antarctic on the swimming performances of potential fish or squid prey could explain the behaviour of elephant seals in these zones, while warmer waters within the PF could correspond to the optimal conditions for potential myctophid prey of elephant seals.},

The model consists of momentum, continuity, temperature, salinity, and density equations and is closed physically and mathematically using the Mellor and Yamada level-2.5 turbulent closure submodel. The irregular bottom slope is represented using a $\sigma$-coordinate transformation, and the horizontal grids comprise unstructured triangular cells. The finite-volume method (FVM) used in this model combines the advantages of a finite-element method (FEM) for geometric flexibility and a finite-difference method (FDM) for simple discrete computation. Currents, temperature, and salinity in the model are computed in the integral form of the equations, which provides a better representation of the conservative laws for mass, momentum, and heat in the coastal region with complex geometry.

abstract = {A state-space assessment model for the northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock off southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland is developed here. The model utilizes information from offshore trawl surveys, inshore acoustic surveys, fishery catch age compositions, partial fishery landings, and tagging. This is done using an approach that avoids the use of subjective data-weighting. Estimates of fishing mortality rates (F) are usually conditional on assumptions about natural mortality rates (M) in stock assessment models. However, by integrating much of the information on northern cod, it is possible to estimate F and M separately. It is also possible to estimate a change in the offshore survey catchability by including inshore acoustic biomass estimates. The proposed model also accounts for biased total catch statistics, which is a common problem in stock assessments. The main goal of the model is to provide realistic projections of the impacts of various levels of future fishery catches on the recovery of this stock. The projections incorporate uncertainty about M and catch. This is vital information for successful future fisheries. The model has been developed for the specific data sources available for northern cod, but it could be adapted to other stocks with similar data sources.},

Here, using assemblage-level tracking of marine predators, we identify AESs for this globally important region and assess current threats and protection levels. Integration of more than 4,000 tracks from 17 bird and mammal species reveals AESs around sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and over the Antarctic continental shelf. Fishing pressure is disproportionately concentrated inside AESs, and climate change over the next century is predicted to impose pressure on these areas, particularly around the Antarctic continent. At present, 7.1% of the ocean south of 40°S is under formal protection, including 29% of the total AESs. The establishment and regular revision of networks of protection that encompass AESs are needed to provide long-term mitigation of growing pressures on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detailed information about animal location and movement is often crucial in studies of natural behaviour and how animals respond to anthropogenic activities. Dead-reckoning can be used to infer such detailed information, but without additional positional data this method results in uncertainty that grows with time. Combining dead-reckoning with new Fastloc-GPS technology should provide good opportunities for reconstructing georeferenced fine-scale tracks, and should be particularly useful for marine animals that spend most of their time under water. We developed a computationally efficient, Bayesian state-space modelling technique to estimate humpback whale locations through time, integrating dead-reckoning using on-animal sensors with measurements of whale locations using on-animal Fastloc-GPS and visual observations. Positional observation models were based upon error measurements made during calibrations. RESULTS: High-resolution 3-dimensional movement tracks were produced for 13 whales using a simple process model in which errors caused by water current movements, non-location sensor errors, and other dead-reckoning errors were accumulated into a combined error term. Positional uncertainty quantified by the track reconstruction model was much greater for tracks with visual positions and few or no GPS positions, indicating a strong benefit to using Fastloc-GPS for track reconstruction. Compared to tracks derived only from position fixes, the inclusion of dead-reckoning data greatly improved the level of detail in the reconstructed tracks of humpback whales. Using cross-validation, a clear improvement in the predictability of out-of-set Fastloc-GPS data was observed compared to more conventional track reconstruction methods. Fastloc-GPS observation errors during calibrations were found to vary by number of GPS satellites received and by orthogonal dimension analysed; visual observation errors varied most by distance to the whale. CONCLUSIONS: By systematically accounting for the observation errors in the position fixes, our model provides a quantitative estimate of location uncertainty that can be appropriately incorporated into analyses of animal movement. This generic method has potential application for a wide range of marine animal species and data recording systems.},

The Northern Hemisphere subspecies encompasses fin whales in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. A recent analysis of 154 mitogenome sequences of fin whales from these two ocean basins and the Southern Hemisphere suggested that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations should be treated as different subspecies. Using these mitogenome sequences, in this study, we conduct analyses on a larger mtDNA control region data set, and on 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 144 of the 154 samples in the mitogenome data set. Our results reveal that North Pacific and North Atlantic fin whales can be correctly assigned to their ocean basin with 99% accuracy. Results of the SNP analysis indicate a correct classification rate of 95%, very low rates of gene flow among ocean basins, and that distinct mitogenome matrilines in the North Pacific are interbreeding. These results indicate that North Pacific fin whales should be recognized as a separate subspecies, with the name B. p. velifera Cope in Scammon 1869 as the oldest available name.},

Our study showed that the seamount population in the OSPAR area (north-east Atlantic) and in the Mediterranean Sea is large with around 557 and 101 seamount-like features, re- spectively. Similarly, seamounts occupy large areas of about 616 000km2 in the OSPAR region and of about 89 500km2 in the Mediterranean Sea. The presence of seamounts in the north-east Atlantic has been known since the late 19th cen- tury, but overall knowledge regarding seamount ecology and geology is still relatively poor. Only 37 seamounts in the OSPAR area (3.5% of all seamounts in the region), 22 in the Mediterranean Sea (9.2%of all seamounts in the region) and 25 in the north-east Atlantic south of the OSPAR area have in situ information. Seamounts mapped in both areas are in general very heterogeneous, showing diverse geophys- ical characteristics.

abstract = {Using end-to-end models for ecosystem-based management requires knowledge of the structure, uncertainty and sensitivity of the model. The Norwegian and Barents Seas (NoBa) Atlantis model was implemented for use in ‘what if' scenarios, combining fisheries management strategies with the influences of climate change and climate variability. Before being used for this purpose, we wanted to evaluate and identify sensitive parameters and whether the species position in the foodweb influenced their sensitivity to parameter perturbation. Perturbing recruitment, mortality, prey consumption and growth by +/- 25% for nine biomass-dominating key species in the Barents Sea, while keeping the physical climate constant, proved the growth rate to be the most sensitive parameter in the model. Their trophic position in the ecosystem (lower trophic level, mid trophic level, top predators) influenced their responses to the perturbations. Top-predators, being generalists, responded mostly to perturbations on their individual life-history parameters. Mid-level species were the most vulnerable to perturbations, not only to their own individual life-history parameters, but also to perturbations on other trophic levels (higher or lower). Perturbations on the lower trophic levels had by far the strongest impact on the system, resulting in biomass changes for nearly all components in the system. Combined perturbations often resulted in non-additive model responses, including both dampened effects and increased impact of combined perturbations. Identifying sensitive parameters and species in end-to-end models will not only provide insights about the structure and functioning of the ecosystem in the model, but also highlight areas where more information and research would be useful—both for model parameterization, but also for constraining or quantifying model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Young animals must learn to forage effectively to survive the transition from parental provisioning to independent feeding. Rapid development of successful foraging strategies is particularly important for capital breeders that do not receive parental guidance after weaning. The intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of variation in ontogeny of foraging are poorly understood for many species. Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) are typical capital breeders; pups are abandoned on the natal site after a brief suckling phase, and must develop foraging skills without external input. We collected location and dive data from recently-weaned grey seal pups from two regions of the United Kingdom (the North Sea and the Celtic and Irish Seas) using animal-borne telemetry devices during their first months of independence at sea. Dive duration, depth, bottom time, and benthic diving increased over the first 40 days. The shape and magnitude of changes differed between regions. Females consistently had longer bottom times, and in the Celtic and Irish Seas they used shallower water than males. Regional sex differences suggest that extrinsic factors, such as water depth, contribute to behavioural sexual segregation. We recommend that conservation strategies consider movements of young na{\"{i}}ve animals in addition to those of adults to account for developmental behavioural changes.},

abstract = {The ecology and status of Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus worldwide are poorly known. In the Mediterranean Sea, modern field studies of cetaceans only began in the late 1980s and this has resulted in rapid advances in knowledge of some species, but not Risso's dolphin. This paper reviews available information on the distribution and ecology of Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean and identifies factors that may negatively affect them in this region. Risso's dolphins occur in continental slope waters throughout the Mediterranean basin and around many of the region's offshore islands and archipelagos. No synoptic estimate of abundance is available for the Mediterranean region, but densities and overall numbers are low in comparison to some other small odontocetes. Diet consists primarily of cephalopods, with a clear preference for mesopelagic squid. The principal known threat to populations in the Mediterranean is entanglement in pelagic drift gillnets. Other potential problems for Risso's dolphins in the Mediterranean include noise disturbance and ingestion of plastic debris. Conservation actions to mitigate the risk of entanglement in fishing gear are likely to benefit Risso's dolphins; specifically, the existing driftnet ban in EU waters should be strictly enforced and extended to the high seas and to waters under non-EU State jurisdiction. More and better data are needed on abundance, distribution, movements, population dynamics and trends in Risso's dolphin populations, and better information on threats (e.g. bycatch in fishing gear) is needed to inform conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r S̈ugetierkunde.},

abstract = {The harbour seal population in Southern Scandinavia has experienced repeated declines caused by hunting and epizootics. These events have shaped the current distribution and abundance of the population. This paper assesses the current status of the population. We estimate trends in abundance of harbour seals from long term survey data, compare these with historic trends inferred from previously published material, and discuss past and potential threats to the harbour seal population of Southern Scandinavia. It is evident that harbour seals have disappeared from haulout areas along the Danish shores of Kattegat and in the westernmost part of the Baltic Sea, where they were previously numerous. In the 1920-30s, when abundance was at its lowest, the population is estimated to have been only a fraction of its original size. Following 30 years of protection the population is currently approaching historic abundance and might have reached the carrying capacity in some areas. Further development depends largely on effects of future epizootics, anthropogenic disturbance, and availability of suitable haulout sites.},

abstract = {Although diving birds and mammals can withstand extended periods under water, field studies show that most perform mainly short, aerobic dives. Theoretical studies of diving have implicitly assumed that prey acquisition increases linearly with time spent searching and have examined strategies that maximize time spent foraging. We present a simple model of diving in seals, where dive durations are influenced by the seal's assessment of patch quality, but are ultimately constrained by oxygen balance. Prey encounters within a dive are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the scale of the patches is such that a predator will encounter a constant prey density during a dive. We investigated the effects of a simple giving-up rule, using recent prey encounter rate to assess patch quality. The model predicts that, for shallow dives, there should always be a net benefit from terminating dives early if no prey are encountered early in the dive. The magnitude of the benefit was highest at low patch densities. The relative gain depended on the magnitude of the travel time and the time taken to assess patch quality and the effect was reduced in deeper dives. As the time taken to decide decreased, the relative benefit increased, up to a maximum, but fell as decision time was reduced further. Frequency distributions of different aspects of dive durations from three deep-diving and two shallow-diving seal species are presented and compared with the model's predictions.},

abstract = {Understanding foraging is important in ecology, as it determines the energy gains and, ultimately, the fitness of animals. However, monitoring prey captures of individual animals is difficult. Direct observations using animal-borne videos have short recording periods, and indirect signals (e.g., stomach temperature) are never validated in the field. We took an integrated approach to monitor prey captures by a predator by deploying a video camera (lasting for 85 min) and two accelerometers (on the head and back, lasting for 50 h) on free-swimming Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins. The movies showed that penguins moved the heads rapidly to capture krill in midwater and fish (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) underneath the sea ice. Captures were remarkably fast (two krill per second in swarms) and efficient (244 krill or 33 P. borchgrevinki in 78-89 min). Prey captures were detected by the signal of head acceleration relative to body acceleration with high sensitivity and specificity (0.83-0.90), as shown by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Extension of signal analysis to the entire behavioral records showed that krill captures were spatially and temporally more variable than P. borchgrevinki captures. Notably, the frequency distribution of krill capture rate closely followed a power-law model, indicating that the foraging success of penguins depends on a small number of very successful dives. The three steps illustrated here (i.e., video observations, linking video to behavioral signals, and extension of signal analysis) are unique approaches to understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecologically important events such as foraging.},

abstract = {Range expansion and increasing densities of large herbivores are held responsible for large-scale habitat degradation in a wide range of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Herbivore-driven ecosystem changes frequently represent predictable transitions from one vegetation state to another. Whether such predictable changes justify the value judgement 'habitat degradation' may be debatable as this strongly depends on individual perspective. To further the debate on herbivore-driven habitat degradation, I apply the concept of alternative stable states to arctic tundra as a framework to capture predictable stepwise vegetation transitions in which the productivity and hence herbivore-carrying capacity increases with grazing pressure. Specifically, evidence is provided that large parts of the tundra biome can be in either of three relatively discrete vegetation states and that changes in reindeer/ caribou density are responsible for sudden, predictable but often reversible state transitions. From this, it appears that the relatively rapidly emerging vegetation changes do not necessarily equate to habitat degradation, but in many cases reflect predictable vegetation change. Acknowledgement of the existence of predictable state transitions in tundra ecosystems may help to evaluate the observed radical vegetation changes occurring throughout the reindeer/caribou range.},

abstract = {Many baleen whales were commercially harvested during the 20th century almost to extinction. Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial “Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments” (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator–prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100 years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1% of K) and fin (16,950, <4% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.},

abstract = {The Protocol on Environmental Protection of the Antarctic Treaty stipulates that the protection of the Antarctic environment and associated ecosystems be fundamentally considered in the planning and conducting of all activities in the Antarctic Treaty area. One of the key pollutants created by human activities in the Antarctic is noise, which is primarily caused by ship traffic (from tourism, fisheries, and research), but also by geophysical research (e.g., seismic surveys) and by research station support activities (including construction). Arguably, amongst the species most vulnerable to noise are marine mammals since they specialize in using sound for communication, navigation and foraging, and therefore have evolved the highest auditory sensitivity among marine organisms. Reported effects of noise on marine mammals in lower-latitude oceans include stress, behavioral changes such as avoidance, auditory masking, hearing threshold shifts, and—in extreme cases—death. Eight mysticete species, 10 odontocete species, and six pinniped species occur south of 60◦S (i.e., in the Southern or Antarctic Ocean). For many of these, the Southern Ocean is a key area for foraging and reproduction. Yet, little is known about how these species are affected by noise. We review the current prevalence of anthropogenic noise and the distribution of marine mammals in the Southern Ocean, and the current research gaps that prevent us from accurately assessing noise impacts on Antarctic marine mammals. A questionnaire given to 29 international experts on marine mammals revealed a variety of research needs. Those that received the highest rankings were (1) improved data on abundance and distribution of Antarctic marine mammals, (2) hearing data for Antarctic marine mammals, in particular a mysticete audiogram, and (3) an assessment of the effectiveness of various noise mitigation options. The management need with the highest score was a refinement of noise exposure criteria. Environmental evaluations are a requirement before conducting activities in the Antarctic. Because of a lack of scientific data on impacts, requirements and noise thresholds often vary between countries that conduct these evaluations, leading to different standards across countries. Addressing the identified research needs will help to implement informed and reasonable thresholds for noise production in the Antarctic and help to protect the Antarctic environment.},

abstract = {Many free-ranging predators have to make foraging decisions with little, if any, knowledge of present resource distribution and availability. The optimal search strategy they should use to maximize encounter rates with prey in heterogeneous natural environments remains a largely unresolved issue in ecology. L{\'{e}}vy walks are specialized random walks giving rise to fractal movement trajectories that may represent an optimal solution for searching complex landscapes. However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested. Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal-attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators-sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins-exhibit L{\'{e}}vy-walk-like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum. Prey density distributions also display L{\'{e}}vy-like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting L{\'{e}}vy-type foraging in natural-like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why L{\'{e}}vy-like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms, from microbes to humans, as a 'rule' that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

I tested these predictions by using phylogenetic independent contrasts from a set of 20 bird species, where flight metabolic rate was measured during laboratory conditions (mainly in wind tunnels). The body mass scaling exponent for P was 0.90, significantly lower than the predicted 7/6. This is partially due to the fact that real birds show an allometric scaling of wing span, which reduces flight cost. P-scope was estimated using direct measurements of BMR in combination with allometric equations. The body mass scaling of P-scope ranged between 0.31 and 0.51 for three data sets, respectively, and none differed significantly from the prediction of 5/12. Body mass scaling exponents of P-scope differed significantly from 0 in all cases, and so P-scope showed a positive body mass scaling in birds in accordance with the prediction.},

abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible. They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems. We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (\textit{Ursus maritimus}) result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters. While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before drawing ecological conclusions from their results.},

abstract = {The vertical distributions of Parmelia olivacea and a few other epiphytic lichens on trunks of deciduous trees were studied in relation to maximum snow depth along an oceanic-continental climate gradient in subarctic Scandinavia. The lower limit of P. olivacea, ''the Olivacea-limit,'' which is usually found above the winter snow surface, showed a high positive correlation with snow depth. This positive correlation also applied to the upper limit of Parmeliopsis ambigua growing on the trunk bases, i.e. ''the Parmeliopsis-limit.'' Hypogymnia physodes and Parmelia sulcata showed a distribution similar to that of P. olivacea on the continental sites but also occurred below the Olivacea-limit at the oceanic sites above the Parmeliopsis-limit. The distribution of Cetraria sepincola showed no relation to either ''limit'' and thus to snow cover. The field observations and experiments indicated that P. olivacea can be exposed to snow or ice for 2 mo without any loss of vitality, but will be killed when repeatedly covered for several winters for periods longer than 2 mo. There was no decline in the vitality of thalli of P. olivacea eroded due to experimental exposure to lasting snow and measured as chlorophyll fluorescence. Nor did storage in ice in the laboratory for 2 mo in darkness at -1-degrees-C decrease vitality as indicated by the fact that the rate of photosynthesis remained unchanged in P. olivacea and increased in P. ambigua, and respiration rates decreased in both species. It is suggested that the degree of definition of the Olivacea- and Parmeliopsis-limits, i.e. their ''sharpness,'' is determined by the polishing effects of wind and ice crystals.},

Capelin are a focal forage species in the Northwest Atlantic ecosystem as they act as an energy conduit from lower to higher trophic levels. Fisheries and Oceans Canada determined that the Newfoundland capelin stock (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Divisions 2J3KL) suffered an order of magnitude decline in biomass in 1990−1991. This collapse was concomitant with drastic changes observed in the ecosystem during the late 1980s and early 1990s. While the results of more than a dozen studies have supported the capelin stock collapse hypothesis, an alternative non-collapse hypothesis proposed that rather than collapsing in 1990−1991, the capelin stock either (1) changed its migratory patterns while the timing of the spring capelin acoustic survey remained constant, leading to a spatio-temporal mismatch between the spring acoustic survey and the stock, or (2) became less migratory and remained inshore year-round, therefore being largely underestimated by the offshore spring and fall acoustic surveys. The collapse and non-collapse hypotheses were tested using multiple independent data sets, which included both fishery-dependent (inshore commercial catch) and fishery-independent (spring and fall acoustic and fall bottom-trawl surveys, capelin larval indices, aerial surveys, predator diet and behavior) data, and diverse statistical methods. The weight of evidence approach led us to reject the non-collapse hypothesis and conclude that the Newfoundland capelin stock did collapse in 1990−1991 with minimal recovery over the subsequent 3 decades.},

abstract = {A dedicated aerial cetacean survey was conducted concurrently to a standardised net trawl survey for krill in order to investigate distribution patterns of large whales and different krill species and to investigate relationships of these. Distance sampling data were used to produce density surface models for humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) around the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Abundance for both species was estimated over two strata in the Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. Distinct distribution patterns suggest horizontal niche partitioning of the two whale species around the WAP, with fin whales aggregating at the shelf edge of the South Shetland Islands in the Drake Passage and humpback whales in the Bransfield Strait. Krill biomass estimated from the concurrent krill survey was used along with CTD data from the same expedition, bathymetric parameters and satellite data on chlorophyll-a and ice concentration to model krill distribution. Comparisons of the predicted distributions of both whale species with the predicted distributions of Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura suggest a complex relationship rather than a straightforward correlation between krill and whales. However, results indicate that fin whales were feeding in an area dominated by T. macrura, while humpback whales were found in areas of higher E. superba biomass. Our results provide abundance estimates for humpback whales and, for the first time, fin whales in the WAP and contribute important information on feeding ecology and habitat use of these two species in the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = {Geothermometers of garnet-clinopyroxene Fe-Mg partition and quartz-mineral oxygen isotope fractionation are normally used to estimate temperatures of eclogite formation. Lately, natural observations and experimental measurements demonstrate that Zr contents in rutile change linearly with temperature and thus can be used as a geothermometer for high-grade metamorphic rock. This study presents a combined application of the three geothermometer to the same locality of low-T/UHP eclogite and enclosed quartz vein at Huangzhen in the Dabie orogen. Analysis of Zr contents in rutile from the eclogite suggests that temperatures calculated for intragrain rutiles are mainly 528 to 589 degrees C, higher than those of 465 to 528 degrees C for intergrain rutiles. The Zr contents of intragrain rutile in garnet are the highest, but the calculated temperatures of 503 similar to 589 degrees C are still variably lower than the peak metamorphic temperatures of 670 degrees C for the eclogite. The Zr content temperatures for rutile in the quartz vein are mainly between 465 and 528 degrees C. High oxygen isotope temperatures of 650 to 695 degrees C were obtained when pairing quartz with such resistant minerals as garnet, zircon and kyanite, suggesting that the refractory minerals have preserved their oxygen isotope compositions acquired during eclogitization and only suffered much weaker retrograde metamorphism than the other minerals in the eclogite. Thus the calculated oxygen isotope temperatures are concordant with the peak eclogite-facies metamorphic conditions. In contrast, low temperatures of 450 to 510 degrees C were calculated when pairing quartz with such non-resistant minerals as rutile, omphacite, paragonite and zoisite/ clinozoisite, indicating the effect of fluid activity during amphibolite-facies retrogression. Temperatures derived from garnet-clinopyroxene Fe-Mg partition can be divided into three groups: (1) 795 to 863 degrees C, (2) 629 to 679 degrees C, and (3) 468 similar to 572 degrees C. The later two groups of temperatures are comparable with the temperatures calculated from the rutile Zr contents and mineral-pair oxygen isotope fractionations, corresponding to equilibration and reequilibration of Fe-Mg and oxygen isotope exchange during eclogite-facies metamorphism and amphibolite-facies retrogression, respectively. The first group temperatures are too high to be compatible with the known conditions for eclogitization, indicating that the omphacite symplectitization results in Fe-Mg partition disequilibria between garnet and some of the omphacite. The fluid activity during the eclogite exhumation may be the basic reason for either reequilibration or disequilibrium of elements and isotope partition by diffusion exchange. The Zr content temperatures in the intragrain rutiles are still lower than the known temperatures for peak eclogitization. This may indicate that these intragrain rutiles were crystallized during prograde metamorphism prior to peak eclogite-facies, but isolated and thus not able to exchange Zr with coexisting zircon to achieve peak eclogite-facies reequilibration. The decrease in intergrain rutile Zr content may be related to recrystallization of rutile, resulting in destruction of Zr exchange equilibrium between rutile and zircon.},

abstract = {Applications of logistic regression in a used-unused design in wildlife habitat studies often suffer from asymmetry of errors: used resource units (landscape locations) are known with certainty, whereas unused resource units might be observed to be used with greater sampling intensity. More appropriate might be to use logistic regression to estimate a resource selection function (RSF) tied to a use-availability design based on independent samples drawn from used and available resource units. We review the theoretical motivation for RSFs and show that sample "contamination" and the exponential form commonly assumed for the RSF are not concerns, contrary to recent statements by Keating and Cherry (2004; Use and interpretation of logistic regression in habitat-selection studies. Journal of Wildlife Management 68:774-789). To do this, we re-derive the use-availability likelihood and show that it can be maximized by logistic regression software. We then consider 2 case studies that illustrate our findings. For our first case study, we fit both RSFs and resource selection probability functions (RSPF) to point count data for 4 bird species with varying levels of occurrence among sample blocks. Drawing on our new derivation of the likelihood, we sample available resource units with replacement and assume overlapping distributions of used and available resource units. Irrespective of overlap, we observed approximate proportionality between predictions of a RSF and RSPF. For our second case study, we evaluate the classic use-availability design suggested by Manly et al. (2002), where availability is sampled without replacement, and we systematically introduce contamination to a sample of available units applied to RSFs for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Although contamination appeared to reduce the magnitude of one RSF beta coefficient, change in magnitude exceeded sampling variation only when > 20% of the available units were confirmed caribou use locations (i.e., contaminated). These empirically based simulations suggest that previously recommended sampling designs are robust to contamination. We conclude with a new validation method for evaluating predictive performance of a RSF and for assessing if the model deviates from being proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) wintering off the eastern coast of South America is referred to by the International Whaling Commission as ‘Breeding Stock A' (BSA). This population was heavily exploited in 20th century modern commercial whaling operations. After more than 30 years of protection, its present status remains unknown. A deterministic sex and age-aggregated population dynamics model was used to estimate the pre-exploitation population size (K), the maximum net recruitment rate (rmax ), the maximum depletion level (Nmin /K), and other quantities of interest of BSA. Input data included modern whaling catch series, absolute estimates of abundance, observed growth rates and indices of relative abundance. A Bayesian statistical method was used to calculate probability distributions for the model parameters. Prior distributions were set on rmax – an uninformative (Uniform [0, 0.106]) and an informative (Normal [0.067, 0.042 ]) – and on the population size in 2005 – N2005 (Uniform [500, 22,000]). A total of 10,000 samples were used to compute the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters using the Sampling-Importance-Resampling algorithm. Sensitivity of model outputs to the priors on rmax , a genetic constraint, data inclusion and catch allocation scenarios was investigated. Medians of the posterior probability distributions of quantities of interest for the base case scenario were: rmax = 0.069 (95% probability intervals [PI] = 0.013–0.104), K = 24,558 (95% PI = 22,791–31,118), Nmin /K = 2% (PI = 0.31%–12.5%), N2006 / K = 27.4% (PI = 18.3%–39.5%), N2020/K = 61.8% (PI = 23.8%–88.6%), and N2040 /K = 97.3% (PI = 31.6%–99.9%). Despite apparent recovery in the past three decades, the western South Atlantic humpback whale population is still low relative to its pre-exploitation size and requires continued conservation efforts.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure.

abstract = {Ecosystems consist of complex dynamic interactions among species and the environment, the understanding of which has implications for predicting the environmental response to changes in climate and biodiversity. However, with the recent adoption of more explorative tools, like Bayesian networks, in predictive ecology, few assumptions can be made about the data and complex, spatially varying interactions can be recovered from collected field data. In this study, we compare Bayesian network modelling approaches accounting for latent effects to reveal species dynamics for 7 geographically and temporally varied areas within the North Sea. We also apply structure learning techniques to identify functional relationships such as prey-predator between trophic groups of species that vary across space and time. We examine if the use of a general hidden variable can reflect overall changes in the trophic dynamics of each spatial system and whether the inclusion of a specific hidden variable can model unmeasured group of species. The general hidden variable appears to capture changes in the variance of different groups of species biomass. Models that include both general and specific hidden variables resulted in identifying similarity with the underlying food web dynamics and modelling spatial unmeasured effect. We predict the biomass of the trophic groups and find that predictive accuracy varies with the models' features and across the different spatial areas thus proposing a model that allows for spatial autocorrelation and two hidden variables. Our proposed model was able to produce novel insights on this ecosystem's dynamics and ecological interactions mainly because we account for the heterogeneous nature of the driving factors within each area and their changes over time. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for additional sources of variation, by combining structure learning from data and experts' knowledge in the model architecture, has the potential for gaining deeper insights into the structure and stability of ecosystems. Finally, we were able to discover meaningful functional networks that were spatially and temporally differentiated with the particular mechanisms varying from trophic associations through interactions with climate and commercial fisheries.},

The degree and scale of philopatry in a population reflect the fitness effects of social facilitation, ecological adaptation and optimal inbreeding. Patterns of breeding-site movement and fidelity are functions of social structure and are frequently sex biased. We report on a female humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) first identified by natural markings off Brazil that subsequently was photographed off Madagascar. The minimum travel distance between these locations is greater than 9800 km, approximately 4000 km longer than any previously reported movement between breeding grounds, more than twice the species' typical seasonal migratory distance and the longest documented movement by a mammal. It is unexpected to find this exceptional long-distance movement between breeding groups by a female, as models of philopatry suggest that male mammals move more frequently or over longer distances in search of mating opportunities. While such movement may be advantageous, especially in changeable or unpredictable circumstances, it is not possible to unambiguously ascribe causality to this rare observation. This finding illustrates the behavioural flexibility in movement patterns that may be demonstrated within a typically philopatric species.},

abstract = {Groups of female and immature sperm whales live at low latitudes and show a stereotypical diving and foraging behavior with dives lasting about 45 min to depths of between 400 and 1200 m. In comparison, physically mature male sperm whales migrate to high latitudes where little is known about their foraging behavior and ecology. Here we use acoustic recording tags to study the diving and acoustic behavior of male sperm whales foraging off northern Norway. Sixty-five hours of tag data provide detailed information about the movements and sound repertoire of four male sperm whales performing 83 dives lasting between 6 and 60 min. Dives ranged in depth between 14 and 1860 m, with a median depth of 175 m, and 92% of the surfacings lasted less than 15 min. The four whales clicked for an average 91% (SD = 10) of the dive duration, where the first usual click was produced at depths ranging between 4 and 218 m and the last usual click at depths ranging between 1 and 1114 m. Echolocation buzzes, which are used as an indication of prey capture attempts, were emitted at depths between 17 and 1860 m, during both the descent and ascent phase of deep dives. The foraging behavior varied markedly with depth, with the timing and duration of prey capture attempts during shallow dives suggesting that the whales target more sparsely distributed prey. In contrast, deep dives involve frequent prey capture attempts and seem to target more dense food layers. The evidence of exploitation of different food layers, including epipelagic prey, is consistent with the hypothesis that male sperm whales may migrate to high latitudes to access a productive, multi-layered foraging habitat. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) provides a biologically sound approximation of the movement path of an animal based on discrete location data, and is a powerful method to quantify utilization distributions. Computing the utilization distribution based on the BBMM while calculating movement parameters directly from the location data, may result in inconsistent and misleading results. We show how the BBMM can be extended to also calculate derived movement parameters. Furthermore we demonstrate how to integrate environmental context into a BBMM-based analysis.\n\nRESULTS: We develop a computational framework to analyze animal movement based on the BBMM. In particular, we demonstrate how a derived movement parameter (relative speed) and its spatial distribution can be calculated in the BBMM. We show how to integrate our framework with the conceptual framework of the movement ecology paradigm in two related but acutely different ways, focusing on the influence that the environment has on animal movement. First, we demonstrate an a posteriori approach, in which the spatial distribution of average relative movement speed as obtained from a "contextually na{\"{i}}ve" model is related to the local vegetation structure within the monthly ranging area of a group of wild vervet monkeys. Without a model like the BBMM it would not be possible to estimate such a spatial distribution of a parameter in a sound way. Second, we introduce an a priori approach in which atmospheric information is used to calculate a crucial parameter of the BBMM to investigate flight properties of migrating bee-eaters. This analysis shows significant differences in the characteristics of flight modes, which would have not been detected without using the BBMM.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm is the first of its kind to allow BBMM-based computation of movement parameters beyond the utilization distribution, and we present two case studies that demonstrate two fundamentally different ways in which our algorithm can be applied to estimate the spatial distribution of average relative movement speed, while interpreting it in a biologically meaningful manner, across a wide range of environmental scenarios and ecological contexts. Therefore movement parameters derived from the BBMM can provide a powerful method for movement ecology research.},

abstract = {The growing number of grey seals in the Baltic Sea has led to a dramatic increase in interactions between seals and fisheries. The conflict has become such a problem that hunting was introduced in Finland in 1998 and the Swedish Environment Protection Agency recommended a cull of grey seals starting in 2001. Culling has been implemented despite the lack of data on population structure. Low levels of migration between regions would mean that intensive culling in specific geographic areas would have disproportionate effects on local population structure and genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellite loci and a 489 bp section of the mtDNA control region to examine the genetic variability and differentiation between three breeding sites in the Baltic Sea and two in the UK. We found high levels of genetic variability in all sampled Baltic groups for both the microsatellites and the control region. There were highly significant differences in microsatellite allele frequencies between all three Baltic breeding sites and between the Baltic sites and the UK sites. However, there were no significant differences in mtDNA control region haplotypes between the Baltic sites. This genetic substructure of the Baltic grey seal populations should be taken into consideration when managing the seal population to prevent the hunting regime from having an adverse effect on genetic diversity by setting hunting quotas separately for the different subpopulations.},

The number of maternity dens observed annually varied from 0 to 36. The arrival of sea ice at Hopen Island in autumn shifted from late October to mid-December during the period 1979 to 2010. Fewer maternity dens were found on Hopen Island in years when sea ice arrived later in the autumn. There were no significant differences in body mass or litter size between female polar bears denning on Hopen Island and females caught elsewhere in Svalbard; however, females denning on Hopen Island were significantly younger than females denning elsewhere in Svalbard. Later arrival of sea ice in the autumn at Hopen island was correlated with lower body mass of adult females and their cubs at emergence. The timing of arrival and departure of sea ice is highly variable but a trend of later arrival in autumn may be affecting the denning ecology of polar bears at the southern extent of their range in Svalbard.},

Using recent satellite-derived current estimates and leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) tracking data, we demonstrate that oceanic currents, usually neglected when analysing tracking data, can substantially distort the observed trajectories. Consequently, this will affect several important results deduced from the analysis of tracking data, such as the evaluation of the orientation skills and the energy budget of animals or the identification of foraging areas. We conclude that currents should be systematically taken into account to ensure the unbiased interpretation of tracking data, which now play a major role in marine conservation biology.},

From 1999 to 2009, 7307 cetacean schoolswere sighted during 271,717 km of survey effort. In 4944 h of land-based observations, 2,968 cetacean groups were detected.Twenty-four specieswere recorded: seven baleen whales, six beaked whales, eight dolphin species, Physeter macrocephalus, Kogia breviceps and Kogia sima. Overall, Delphinus delphis was the most frequently sighted species, but its encounter rate decreased in June?November, coinciding with the presence of Stenella frontalis in the region.Tursiops truncatus, P. macrocephalus and Grampus griseus were frequently encountered year-round, whereas large baleen whales showed a distinct peak in encounter rates in March?May. Mesoplodonts were fairly common and appear to be present throughout the year. These findings fill in a significant gap in the knowledge of cetaceans occurring in a poorly studied region of the North Atlantic, providing much needed data to inform management initiatives.},

abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.

abstract = {As baleen whales recover from severe exploitation, they are probably subject to a wide variety of threats within the Antarctic marine ecosystem, including directed take. Here we review both the management and current status of Antarctic baleen whales and consider those threats likely to impact on them. Threats range from global problems - marine pollution and climate change - to localized issues including shipping, habitat disturbance, unregulated wildlife tourism and fishery activities. We identify the most pressing anthropogenic threats to baleen whales including scientific whaling and climate change. It is unclear whether current management approaches will be able to effectively encompass all these threats while also accounting both for the differing levels of scientific understanding and for the differing recovery rates of the whale species. For management we recommend the following: 1) incorporation of both ecosystem considerations and the suite of identified threats not limited to direct take, 2) identification of measurable indicators of changes in whales that allow more certainty in monitoring of populations and the environment, and 3) recognition of significant relationships between baleen whales and habitat features to provide information on distribution and use. {\textcopyright} Copyright Antarctic Science Ltd 2011.},

abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic noise on marine fauna is of increasing conservation concern with vessel noise being one of the major contributors. Animals that rely on shallow coastal habitats may be especially vulnerable to this form of pollution. Very limited information is available on how much noise from ship traffic individual animals experience, and how they may react to it due to a lack of suitable methods. To address this, we developed long-duration audio and 3D-movement tags (DTAGs) and deployed them on three harbor seals and two gray seals in the North Sea during 2015–2016. These tags recorded sound, accelerometry, magnetometry, and pressure continuously for up to 21 days. GPS positions were also sampled for one seal continuously throughout the recording period. A separate tag, combining a camera and an accelerometer logger, was deployed on two harbor seals to visualize specific behaviors that helped interpret accelerometer signals in the DTAG data. Combining data from depth, accelerometer, and audio sensors, we found that animals spent 6.6%–42.3% of the time hauled out (either on land or partly submerged), and 5.3%–12.4% of their at-sea time resting at the sea bottom, while the remaining time was used for traveling, resting at surface, and foraging. Animals were exposed to audible vessel noise 2.2%–20.5% of their time when in water, and we demonstrate that interruption of functional behaviors (e.g., resting) in some cases coincides with high-level vessel noise. Two-thirds of the ship noise events were traceable by the AIS vessel tracking system, while one-third comprised vessels without AIS. This preliminary study demonstrates how concomitant long-term continuous broadband on-animal sound and movement recordings may be an important tool in future quantification of disturbance effects of anthropogenic activities at sea and assessment of long-term population impacts on pinnipeds.},

Lower power magnetometers can also be used with some limitations. Here, we present an integrated and simplified method for estimating body rotations and SA applicable to both gyroscopes and magnetometers, enabling a direct comparison of these two sensors. We use a tag with both sensors to demonstrate how caudal-oscillation rate and SA are adjusted by a diving whale in response to rapidly changing buoyancy forces as the lungs compress while descending. The two sensors gave similar estimates of the dynamic forces, demonstrating that magnetometers may offer a simpler low-power alternative for miniature tags in some applications.},

The decline in great whale numbers, estimated to be at least 66% and perhaps as high as 90%, has likely altered the structure and function of the oceans, but recovery is possible and in many cases is already underway.

abstract = {During foraging dives, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) produce long series of regular clicks at 0.5-2 s intervals interspersed with rapid-click buzzes called "creaks". Sound, depth and orientation recording Dtags were attached to 23 whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico to test whether the behaviour of diving sperm whales supports the hypothesis that creaks are produced during prey capture. Sperm whales spent most of their bottom time within one or two depth bands, apparently feeding in vertically stratified prey layers. Creak rates were highest during the bottom phase: 99.8% of creaks were produced in the deepest 50% of dives, 57% in the deepest 15% of dives. Whales swam actively during the bottom phase, producing a mean of 12.5 depth inflections per dive. A mean of 32% of creaks produced during the bottom phase occurred within 10 s of an inflection (13x more than chance). Sperm whales actively altered their body orientation throughout the bottom phase with significantly increased rates of change during creaks, reflecting increased manoeuvring. Sperm whales increased their bottom foraging time when creak rates were higher. These results all strongly support the hypothesis that creaks are an echolocation signal adapted for foraging, analogous to terminal buzzes in taxonomically diverse echolocating species.},

abstract = {Models that predict distribution are now widely used to understand the patterns and processes of plant and animal occurrence as well as to guide conservation and management of rare or threatened species. Application of these methods has led to corresponding studies evaluating the sensitivity of model performance to requisite data and other factors that may lead to imprecise or false inferences. We expand upon these works by providing a relative measure of the sensitivity of model parameters and prediction to common sources of error, bias, and variability. We used a one-at-a-time sample design and GPS location data for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to assess one common species-distribution model: a resource selection function. Our measures of sensitivity included change in coefficient values, prediction success, and the area of mapped habitats following the systematic introduction of geographic error and bias in occurrence data, thematic misclassification of resource maps, and variation in model design. Results suggested that error, bias and model variation have a large impact on the direct interpretation of coefficients. Prediction success and definition of important habitats were less responsive to the perturbations we introduced to the baseline model. Model coefficients, prediction success, and area of ranked habitats were most sensitive to positional error in species locations followed by sampling bias, misclassification of resources, and variation in model design. We recommend that researchers report, and practitioners consider, levels of error and bias introduced to predictive species-distribution models. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are the most effective means for evaluating and focusing improvements on input data and considering the range of values possible from imperfect models.

abstract = {To ensure economic viability over time, any efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals need to reconcile conservation with development interventions. Particularly, in marginal and risk prone areas erosion of resilience could make production systems more susceptible to environmental risks that compromise the economic security. By longitudinal analyses of long-term data records we investigated the impacts of big push policies on Saami pastoral ecosystems in Arctic Norway. The big push was accompanied by reindeer herd accumulation and a corresponding degradation of resilience, increasing the susceptibility to herd losses to predators and adverse winters. For the last 20 years the Norwegian government has worked to halt degradation of pasture ecosystems and reduce susceptibility to environmental risks. These intended win-win policies have mainly been based on economic incentives, which have been developed together with Saami pastoralists through negotiated agreements. We argue that the continued degradation of the Saami pastoral ecosystems is a "ghost of the development past", as the big push policies have resulted in an economic security trap (EST). The gradual reduction of resilience has persisted as the ex post payments of disaster relief and predator compensation have impeded the long-term actions to reduce susceptibility to environmental risks, i.e., ex ante policies, thereby increasing dependency on elevated economic inputs to manage the risks. The transfer of liability for managing risks to the benefactor, both through ex ante and ex post policies, has further discouraged and constrained opportunities for adaptation by the pastoralists.},

abstract = {Fishery management decisions are commonly guided by stock assessment models that aggregate outputs across the spatial domain of the species. With refined understanding of spatial population structures, scientists have begun to address how spatiotemporal mismatches among the scale of ecological processes, data collection programs, and stock assessment methods (or assumptions) influence the reliability, and ultimately, appropriateness of regional fishery management (e.g., assigning regional quotas). Development and evaluation of spatial modeling techniques to improve fisheries assessment and management have increased rapidly in recent years. We overview the historical context of spatial models in fisheries science, highlight recent advances in spatial modeling, and discuss how spatial models have been incorporated into the management process. Despite limited examples where spatial assessment models are used as the basis for management advice, continued investment in fine-scale data collection and associated...},

abstract = {The metabolic rate of harp (Pagophilus groenlandicus), harbor (Phoca vitulina), and ringed seals (Pusa hispida) was measured at various temperatures in air and water to estimate basal metabolic rates (BMRs) in these species. The basal rate and body composition of three harp seals were also measured throughout the year to examine the extent to which they vary seasonally. Marine mammalian carnivores generally have BMRs that are over three times the rates expected from body mass in mammals generally, both as a response to a cold-water distribution and to carnivorous food habits with the basal rates of terrestrial carnivores averaging about 1.8 times the mean of mammals. Phocid seals, however, have basal rates of metabolism that are 30% lower than other marine carnivores. Captive seals undergo profound changes in body mass and food consumption throughout the year, and after accounting for changes in body mass, the lowest rate of food intake occurs in summer. Contrary to earlier observations, harp seals also have lower basal rates during summer than during winter, but the variation in BMR, relative to mass expectations, was not associated with changes in the size of fat deposits. The summer reduction in energy expenditure and food consumption correlated with a reduction in BMR. That is, changes in BMR account for a significant portion of the seasonal variation in energy expenditure in the harp seal. Changes in body mass of harp seals throughout the year were due not only to changes in the size of body fat deposits, but also to changes in lean body mass. These results suggest that bioenergetics models used to predict prey consumption by seals should include time-variant energy requirements.},

abstract = {<p>Knowledge on the ecology of humpback whales in the eastern North Atlantic is lacking by comparison with most other ocean basins. Humpback whales were historically over-exploited in the region and are still found in low relative abundances. This, coupled with their large range makes them difficult to study. With the aim of informing more effective conservation measures in Ireland, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group began recording sightings and images suitable for photo-identification of humpback whales from Irish waters in 1999. Validated records submitted by members of the public and data from dedicated surveys were analysed to form a longitudinal study of individually recognizable humpback whales. The distribution, relative abundance and seasonality of humpback whale sighting records are presented, revealing discrete important areas for humpback whales in Irish coastal waters. An annual easterly movement of humpback whales along the southern coast of Ireland is documented, mirroring that of their preferred prey: herring and sprat. Photo-identification images were compared with others collected throughout the North Atlantic (N = 8016), resulting in matches of two individuals between Ireland and Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands but no matches to known breeding grounds (Cape Verde and West Indies). This study demonstrates that combining public records with dedicated survey data is an effective approach to studying low-density, threatened migratory species over temporal and spatial scales that are relevant to conservation and management.</p>},

Here we show how variability and change in sea ice cover in the Barents Sea, the largest shelf sea of the Arctic, affect the population dynamics of a keystone species of the ice-associated food web, the polar cod (Boreogadus saida). The data-driven biophysical model of polar cod early life stages assembled here predicts a strong mechanistic link between survival and variation in ice cover and temperature, suggesting imminent recruitment collapse should the observed ice-reduction and heating continue. Backtracking of drifting eggs and larvae from observations also demonstrates a northward retreat of one of two clearly defined spawning assemblages, possibly in response to warming. With annual to decadal ice-predictions under development the mechanistic physical-biological links presented here represent a powerful tool for making long-term predictions for the propagation of polar cod stocks.},

Using field measurements and population data, we find that marine mammals can enhance primary productivity in their feeding areas by concentrating nitrogen near the surface through the release of flocculent fecal plumes. Whales and seals may be responsible for replenishing 2.3×104 metric tons of N per year in the Gulf of Maine's euphotic zone, more than the input of all rivers combined. This upward “whale pump” played a much larger role before commercial harvest, when marine mammal recycling of nitrogen was likely more than three times atmospheric N input. Even with reduced populations, marine mammals provide an important ecosystem service by sustaining productivity in regions where they occur in high densities.},

abstract = {Saproxylic insects play an important part in decomposing dead wood in healthy forest ecosystems, but little is known about their role in the aftermath of large-scale forest mortality caused by pest insect outbreaks. We used window traps to study short-term changes in the abundance and community structure of saproxylic beetles following extensive mortality of mountain birch in sub-arctic northern Norway caused by an outbreak of geometrid moths. Three to five years after the outbreak, the proportion of obligate saproxylic individuals in the beetle community was roughly 10% higher in forest damaged by the outbreak than in undamaged forest. This was mainly due to two early-successional saproxylic beetle species. Facultative saproxylic beetles showed no consistent differences between damaged and undamaged forest. These findings would suggest a weak numerical response of the saproxylic beetle community to the dead wood left by the outbreak. We suggest that species-specific preferences for certain wood decay stages may limit the number of saproxylic species that respond numerically to an outbreak at a particular time, and that increases in responding species may be constrained by limitations to the amount of dead wood that can be exploited within a given timeframe (i.e. satiation effects). Low diversity of beetle species or slow development of larvae in our cold sub-arctic study region may also limit numerical responses. Our study suggests that saproxylic beetles, owing to weak numerical responses, may so far have played a minor role in decomposing the vast quantities of dead wood left by the moth outbreak.},

abstract = {Vole-vegetation interactions in a predation-free taiga environment of northern Fennoscandia were studied by transferring vegetation from natural Microtus habitats into a greenhouse, where three habitat islands of about 30 m(2) were created. The 'islands' were subjected to simulated summer conditions and a paired female field vole, Microtusagrestis, was introduced to each 'island'. The development of the female and her young was followed by recurrent live trapping. The development of the vegetation was followed by recurrent marking and censusing of plant shoots at intervals of five days. In the next growing season, two 'islands' were subjected to a new grazing treatment to study the impacts of repeated grazing on the vegetation and on the growth and reproduction of voles. Plant biomasses were harvested at the end of each trial. In all trials, the biomasses of graminoids and non-toxic herbs other than ferns, fireweeds and rosaceous plants were profoundly decimated. Even the biomass of a toxic herb Aconitum lycoctonum decreased largely at pace with the palatable herbs. The least preferred plant categories maintained their biomasses at control levels. Their neutral collective response was created by opposite species-level trends. Species typical for moist and nutrient-rich forests suffered from vole grazing, whereas the biomass of species adapted to disturbed habitats increased. In spite of the dramatic changes in the vegetation, the introduced female voles survived throughout the trials and reproduced normally. The young of their first litters survived well and reached the final weights typical for individuals starting to winter as immatures. We conclude that most of the plant biomass found on productive boreal forest floors is potential food for field voles and remains palatable for them even when subjected to recurrent, severe grazing. If nothing else than summer resources were limiting the growth of the field vole populations, the plants currently dominating moist and nutrient-rich taiga floors could not survive in this habitat.},

abstract = {During recent decades satellite telemetry using the Argos system has been used extensively to track many species of marine mammals. However, the aquatic behavior of most of these species results in a high number of locations with low or unknown accuracy. Argos data are often filtered to reduce the noise produced by these locations, typically by removing data points requiring unrealistic swimming speeds. Unfortunately, this method excludes a considerable number of good-quality locations that have high traveling speeds that are the result of two locations being taken very close in time. We present an alternative algorithm, based on swimming speed, distance between successive locations, and turning angles. This new filter was tested on 67 tracks from nine different marine mammal species: ringed, bearded, gray, harbor, southern elephant, and Antarctic fur seals, walruses, belugas, and narwhals. The algorithm removed similar percentages of low-quality locations (Argos location classes [LC] B and A) compared to a filter based solely on swimming speed, but preserved significantly higher percentages of good-quality positions (mean ± SE% of locations removed was 4.1 ± 0.8%vs. 12.6 ± 1.2% for LC 3; 6.8 ± 0.6%vs. 15.7 ± 0.9% for LC 2; and 11.4 ± 0.7%vs. 21.0 ± 0.9% for LC 1). The new filter was also more effective at removing unlikely, conspicuous deviations from the track's path, resulting in fewer locations being registered on land and a significant reduction in home range size, when using the Minimum Convex Polygon method, which is sensitive to outliers.},

Perturbations of the Gulf Stream cyclonic front are commonly observed as folded wave patterns in routine satellite-derived analyses of the western boundary of the Gulf Stream between Cape Hatteras and Miami. The disturbances consist of southward-flowing warm filaments or streamers of near-surface Gulf Stream water, 15 to 20 m deep, which can extend 35 to 40 km over the outer shelf around a cold upwelled core. Downstream dimensions of the filaments reach 100 to 200 km in the region from Jupiter, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina, 10 to 50 km south of Jupiter, and 200 to 300 km between Charleston and Cape Hatteras. The features are defined as cyclonic, cold-core frontal eddies due to their flow and water mass properties. They appear to form from amplified waves in the Gulf Stream cyclonic front on an annual average of one every two weeks but with considerable monthly variability. They can persist up to three weeks and travel to the north with the same phase speed as the waves, approx. 40 cm s-1. The cyclonic circulation in frontal eddies provides a means for rapid shelf-Gulf Stream water exchange. The eddies appear to control the residence time of the outer shelf waters, defined as the mean separation time between eddy events, or approx. two weeks. Upwelling in the cold core extended into the euphotic zone (45 m) and shoreward (35 to 40 km) beneath the southward-flowing warm filament in a bottom intrusion layer 20 m thick. The annual nitrogen input to the shelf waters by this process is estimated as 55,000 tons each year, about twice all other estimated nitrogen sources combined; it can support an annual carbon production by phytoplankton of 32 to 64 g C m-2y-1 with no nitrogen recycling.},

Thus, there has been an interest in the literature to provide flexible models and computationally efficient methods for non-stationary phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to spatial modelling provides a flexible class of non-stationary models where explanatory variables can be easily included in the dependence structure. In addition, the SPDE approach enables computationally efficient Bayesian inference with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) available through the R-package r-inla. We illustrate the suggested modelling framework with a case study of annual precipitation in southern Norway, and compare a non-stationary model with dependence structure governed by elevation to a stationary model. Further, we use a simulation study to explore the annual precipitation models. We investigate identifiability of model parameters and whether the deviance information criterion (DIC) is able to distinguish datasets from the non-stationary and stationary models.},

abstract = {As the world's oceans continue to undergo drastic changes, understanding the role of key species therein will become increasingly important. To explore the role of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua Gadidae) in the ecosystem, we reviewed biological interactions between cod and its prey, predators and competitors within six ecosystems taken from a broad geographic range: three are cod-capelin (Mallotus villosus Osmeridae) systems towards cod's northern Atlantic limit (Barents Sea, Iceland and Newfoundland-Labrador), two are more diverse systems towards the southern end of the range (North Sea and Georges Bank-Gulf of Maine), and one is a species-poor system with an unusual physical and biotic environment (Baltic Sea). We attempt a synthesis of the role of cod in these six ecosystems and speculate on how it might change in response to a variety of influences, particularly climate change, in a fashion that may apply to a wide range of species. We find cod prey, predators and competitors functionally similar in all six ecosystems. Conversely, we estimate different magnitudes for the role of cod in an ecosystem, with consequently different effects on cod, their prey and predator populations. Fishing has generally diminished the ecological role of cod. What remains unclear is how additional climate variability will alter cod stocks, and thus its role in the ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Survey design, sampling protocols, and data analysis procedures are described. Mean krill density across the survey area was estimated to be 21.4 g m-2, and total biomass was estimated to be 44.3 million tonnes (CV 11.4%). This biomass estimate leads to a revised estimate of precautionary yield for krill in the Scotia Sea of 4 million tonnes. However, before the fishery can be permitted to expand to this level, it will be necessary to establish mechanisms to avoid concentration of fishing effort, particularly near colonies of land-breeding krill predators, and to consider the effects of krill immigrating into the region from multiple sources.},

abstract = {In protected areas maintaining existing phytodiversity is an important conservation target. In this study we analysed the effects of abandonment on plant species composition and species richness over a period of nine years in a montane grassland in the Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) region Eisenwurzen (Styria, Austria). Additional investigations concerned the number of Red Data List species, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values, indicator values for mowing, grazing and trampling tolerance, temporal sequence of phenological phases and seven plant traits. We differentiated two topography-related habitat types: an initially species-rich sheep pasture on a steep, south-facing slope and a less species-rich meadow on a flat site immediately below, with a comparatively higher nutrient and water supply in the topsoil. Testing a possible management alternative, the effects of continued low-intensity sheep grazing on the slope were also analysed. In spring 2001, one permanent plot of 50 m(2) was established in the centre of each habitat type and treatment. Our results show that the long-term effects of abandonment on grassland vegetation depend largely on local site conditions. Nutrient availability in the soil seems to be an especially important factor. On the abandoned flat site, floristic composition and physiognomy changed dramatically within four years; a high species turnover and a decline in phytodiversity could be observed. In contrast, we found only minor effects on the abandoned slope site even nine years after abandonment. If the maintenance of existing phytodiversity is a conservation target, suitable management operations have to be carried out at shorter intervals (at least every 3 years) in habitats with nutrient-rich soils than in nutrient-poor habitats (approx. 5 to 10 years). From a nature conservation point of view, low-intensity sheep grazing may be a suitable management alternative to mowing.},

Populations, or stocks, are at or well below their conservation reference points. The lack of recovery has been linked to ongoing fishing mortality (targeted, bycatch), changes to life history (reductions in age and size at maturity, truncations in age and size structure), and increased natural mortality. Emergent and demographic Allee effects, coupled with altered interspecific interactions, render questionable the presumption that the recovery of heavily depleted populations can be reliably forecasted by population dynamical behaviour during decline. Contrary to international commitments and inconsistent with fishery rebuilding plans elsewhere, cod recovery plans exclude target and limit reference points, recovery timelines, and harvest control rules.

abstract = {Direct measures of energy expenditure are difficult to obtain in marine mammals, and accelerometry may be a useful proxy. Recently its utility has been questioned as some analyses derived their measure of activity level by calculating the sum of accelerometry-based values and then comparing this summation to summed (total) energy expenditure (the so-called “time trap”). To test this hypothesis, we measured oxygen consumption of captive fur seals and sea lions wearing accelerometers during submerged swimming and calculated total and rate of energy expenditure. We compared these values with two potential proxies of energy expenditure derived from accelerometry data: flipper strokes and dynamic body acceleration (DBA). Total number of strokes, total DBA, and submergence time all predicted total oxygen consumption

abstract = {Stomach contents from 129 individuals were used to examine the variation in the diet of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the northeast Atlantic. Samples were obtained from dolphins found stranded along the Irish coast (n=76) between 1990 and 2004, representing neritic foraging, and individuals incidentally captured in the Irish albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) driftnet fishery (n=58) between 1996 and 1999, representing offshore foraging. A total of 46 prey species were recorded consisting of 31 fish species and 15 cephalopods. The remains of a total of 15,283 prey items were recovered from the stomachs of offshore dolphins. Teleost fish were numerically the most important prey group (95% prey numbers), with cephalopods comprising only 5%. A small number of crustaceans were also recorded. Fish representing at least six families and 16 species were identified. Myctophids dominated the fish component accounting for 54% of the fish recovered. Despite the dominance of myctophids, at a species level the carangid Trachurus trachurus was the most commonly recorded, followed by the myctophids Myctophum punctatum and Notoscopelus kroyeri; combined the three species comprised 92% of fish prey. Fish (97%) also formed the dominant portion of the stomach contents of dolphins from the neritic area. Gadidae comprised 59% of the fish component of the neritic dolphin diet, and the most commonly occurring fish were Trisopterus spp. (45%) and Gobiidae (28%). In both groups, the foraging strategy appears to involve targeting relatively small-sized shoaling fish. The offshore dolphins were found to feed nocturnally when the migrating deep scattering layer species approaches the surface. In neritic areas, aggregations of small, pelagic fish are preyed upon. For the offshore group, a positive relationship was found between dolphin body length and total prey numbers and between body length and prey species number, but not between dolphin body length and proportion of cephalopods in the diet. No significant difference for these variables was found between different age-sex maturity groups. For the inshore group, no correlation was found between dolphin body length and total prey numbers, prey species number or proportion of cephalopod in the diet. The stomachs of stranded females contained a significantly higher number of prey items than stranded males, but there were no other significant differences between age-sex maturity groups for fish species number of proportion of cephalopod in the diet. Nine dolphins from the offshore group had only milk in their stomachs (aged 0-3 months), while three (aged 3-6 months) had both milk and solid food suggesting that weaning occurs between 3 and 6 months.},

abstract = {Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993–2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.},

abstract = {Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0{+/-}0.32 m s-1) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at $\sim$1-1.5 m s-1 after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46 s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge.},

abstract = {The 2004 Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR)-ECO expedition on the R.V. G.O. Sars provided the first opportunity to correlate oceanic distributions of cetaceans with synoptic acoustic (ADCP to 700 m depth, multi-beam echosounders) measurements of high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) potential habitat (spatial scale<100 km). The identified habitat features were tested with independent observations from the Icelandic combined cetacean and redfish cruises in 2001 and 2003 using data from a 3D ocean general circulation model of the MAR region (Regional Oceans Modelling System (ROMS) model 5 km resolution). The spatial autocorrelation of sampled encounter rates of sperm Physeter macrocephalus and sei whales Balaenoptera borealis indicated scale-dependent variability in the distribution of both species. Despite the large area surveyed, the observations of both species exhibited a strong small-scale structure (range parameter 20-50 km), indicating affinities to cross-seamount or cross-frontal structures. Potential cross-seamount and cross-frontal habitat structures were derived from the acoustic transect data by analysing fine-scale gradients in the 3D flow patterns and bathymetry, including interactions between frontal and topographic parameters. PLS regression was used to determine the potential habitat drivers of sperm and sei whales, both during the G.O. Sars cruise and during the Icelandic cruises in 2001 and 2003. The selected parameters, which reflected flow gradients interacting with the steep topography, were finally applied for modelling the habitat suitability of both target species along the northern MAR using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The results suggest aggregations of sperm and sei whales along the MAR are primarily associated with fine-scale frontal processes interacting with the topography in the upper 100 m of the water column just north of the Sub-Polar Front (SPF) and the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ). As moderate and high habitat suitabilities were estimated only for areas downstream from the SPF, the findings suggest that the animals capitalise on secondary production maintained by enhanced primary production associated with the frontal processes in the upper part of the water column in the CGFZ and at the Faraday Seamounts. Further studies are encouraged to evaluate the importance of the bio-physical coupling, and the significance of small-scale frontal processes in the surface and subsurface waters north of the SPF for the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels in the North Atlantic. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To fully understand how diving seabirds and marine mammals balance the potentially conflicting demands of holding their breath while living their lives underwater (and maintaining physiological homeostasis during exercise, feeding, growth, and reproduction), physiological studies must be conducted with animals in their natural environments. The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or “biologging”, has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). With a variety of approaches and high demand for data on the physiology of diving seabirds and marine mammals, the future of field studies is bright.},

abstract = {Until recently, large apex consumers were ubiquitous across the globe and had been for millions of years. The loss of these animals may be humankind's most pervasive influence on nature. Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

abstract = {The rate of growth of any population is a quantity of interest in conservation and management and is constrained by biological factors. In this study, recent data on life-history parameters influencing rates of population growth in humpback whales [Megaptera novaeangliae], including survival, age at first parturition and calving rate are reviewed. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compute a distribution of rates of increase (ROIs) taking into account uncertainty in biological parameter estimates. Two approaches for computing juvenile survival are proposed, which taken into account along with other life-history data, resulted in the following estimates of the rate of population growth: Approach A: mean of 7.3%/year (95% CI = 3.5-10.5%/year) and Approach B: mean of 8.6%/year (95% CI = 5.0–11.4%/year). It is proposed that the upper 99% quantile of the resulting distribution of the ROI for Approach B (11.8%/year) be established as the maximum plausible ROI for humpback whales and be used in population assessment of the species. Possible sources of positive and negative biases in the present estimates are presented and include measurement error in estimation of life-history parameters, changes in the environment within the period these quantities are measured, density dependence or other natural factors. However, it is difficult to evaluate potential biases without additional data. The methods presented in this study can be applied to other species for which life-history parameters are available and are useful in assessing plausibility in the estimation of population growth rates from time series of abundance estimates. },

abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) exemplifies the key role of marine crustaceans in fisheries, foodwebs, and biogeochemical cycles. Ecological understanding and policy decisions require information on population trends. We have therefore worked with international colleagues to publish KRILLBASE, a database of fishery-independent krill population information for every decade since the 1970s. These data were used by Cox et al. (2018) who dispute the evidence for a late twentieth-century decline in krill density (number per unit area) in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and claim to overturn much of recent thinking about climate-driven change in krill populations. They support this claim with an analysis which reaffirms one non-significant result from an earlier paper but does not challenge the five significant results from that paper or those of other studies which support a decline. In this comment we examine the methods which led Cox and coauthors to conclude that krill density has been stable over the last 40 years. Although these authors provide a potentially useful approach, we show that their analysis was biased by the exclusion of usable net types, the inclusion of negatively biased data and down-weighting of high densities in the early part of the analysis period, the absence of recent data from the north of the sector, and a lack of statistical hypothesis testing. These factors maximise the chances of failure to detect a real decline. To aid future analyses we provide recommendations to supplement those which accompany KRILLBASE. We also suggest the need for consensus scientific advice on krill population dynamics based on agreed standards of evidence, evaluation of uncertainty, and a thorough understanding of the data. This will be more useful to policy makers and other stakeholders than polarised opinions. Meanwhile, the evidence for a decline in krill density still stands.},

abstract = {The coastal preferences of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) intensify their exposure to human activities. The harbour porpoise Iberian population is presently very small and information about the threats it endures is vital for the conservation efforts that are being implemented to avoid local extinction. The present study explored the possible relation between the accumulation of trace elements by porpoises and their sex, body length, nutritional state, presence of parasites and gross pathologies. The concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) were evaluated in 42 porpoises stranded in Portugal between 2005 and 2013. Considering European waters, porpoises stranded in Portugal present the highest Hg concentrations and the lowest Cd concentrations, which may reflect dietary preferences and the geographic availability of these pollutants. While no effect of sex on trace element concentrations was detected, there was a positive relationship between porpoise body length and the concentration of Cd, Hg and Pb. Animals in worse nutritional condition showed higher levels of Zn. Harbour porpoises with high parasite burdens showed lower levels of Zn and As in all analysed tissues and also lower levels of renal Ni, while those showing gross pathologies presented higher Zn and Hg levels. This is the first data on the relationship between trace elements and health-related variables in porpoises from southern European Atlantic waters, providing valuable baseline information about the contamination status of this vulnerable population.},

abstract = {Estimates of abundance are calculated for six cetacean species in the Southern Ocean south of 60° in the austral summer, using the IWC database estimation package (DESS). The sightings data in DESS were collected during the 1978/79 to 1997/98 IWC/IDCR and SOWER circumpolar surveys. Abundance estimates are developed for the first (1978/79–1983/84), second (1985/86–1990/91) and currently incomplete third (1991/92–1997/98) circumpolar sets of surveys. The strata surveyed in these three sets cover about 65%, 81% and 68% respectively of the open ocean area south of 60°S. The surveys were designed for Antarctic minke whales and may not be optimal for all these species. Furthermore, the estimates presented below (CVs in brackets) should not necessarily be considered as estimates for the whole Southern Hemisphere. Some results are also presented for hourglass dolphins and sei whales, but estimates of abundance are not considered reliable for those two species. Effective search half-width and mean school size were estimated by pooling across strata and years. Pooling is effected separately for each circumpolar set of surveys. Additional pooling across closing and passing modes did not introduce substantial bias. The most frequently sighted species were minke, southern bottlenose, sperm, humpback and killer whales; the effective search half-widths for all five increase over time. The sensitivity of the abundance estimates to a number of factors is investigated, none of which appears to impact the results substantially, except that the incorporation of ‘like species' would increase the estimate for blue whales from the third circumpolar set of surveys by 25% and for fin whales by 61%. In general, the assumption that 100% of schools on the trackline are sighted introduces variable negative bias to estimates for all species. Only two significant trends in abundance over time (for comparable areas) were detected, but both may be artefacts of changes in survey design.},

abstract = {Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are sexually dimorphic in several respects, including size, latitudinal distribution, and social structure. Females are known to have complex social structures, including long-term bonds, but the social structures of sexually mature or maturing males have received much less attention. Using data from aggrega- tions of males off Norway, Nova Scotia, New Zealand, and the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, we examined aggregation size, resi- dence times within aggregations, clustering at the surface, and long-term bonds. Results were generally consistent among study areas. The aggregations found in each area contained around 10–30 males at any time, and were usually a few tens of kilometres across. Mean residence times within aggregations ranged from a few days to a few weeks. Close clustering at the surface was rare, but present at each site. There was no evidence for preferred companionship between individuals at any temporal scale in any of the study areas. The rarity of clustering and the apparent lack of long-term relationships amongst male sperm whales contrast strongly with results of studies on females, suggesting that both close spatial proximity at the surface and permanent bonds between individuals may be a consequence of the need for care of the young.},

abstract = {We present the first data on attendance patterns, at-sea movements and (living behaviour of Antarctic fur seals breeding at Bouvetoya (Bouvet Island), Southern Ocean, While other colonies have been extensively studied, this remote and second largest global population remains relatively unknown. Time depth recorders and satellite relay data loggers were deployed on breeding females during the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 Summers. Attendance and foraging patterns were similar to those observed at colonies in the Scotia Sea region where Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is the predominant prey. Early to mid-lactation trips ranged within similar to 100 km of the island, usually towards the west; the dominant direction shifted later in the season and the range also increased markedly to a peak between early February and early March. Solar elevation influenced arrivals and departures from the island, with most departures occurring around sunset. Diurnal variations in diving behaviour were consistent with the vertical migration of krill. Diving frequency was high er at night and diving effort peaked around morning twilight, Afternoon deep diving was common, suggesting that females might target dense daytime krill aggregations between the photic zone and the thermocline. Trip durations increased throughout early to mid-lactation, peaking in late January to early March, before, again decreasing towards the end of lactation. Our results illustrate the substantial variability, both between individuals and within individuals over time, that is likely to reflect variations in prey distribution and in the growth requirements of pups. Such variations need to be taken into account when estimating habitat use and resource utilisation in marine top predators.},

While scientists routinely account for some of this uncertainty in population models, the mechanisms by which this translates into decision-making and policy are problematic and can lead to unintentional overexploitation. Here, we explicitly track the role of measurement uncertainty and environmental variation in the decision-making process for setting catch quotas. Analyzing 109 well-sampled stocks from all oceans, we show that current practices may attain 55% recovery on average, while richer decision methods borrowed from robotics yield 85% recovery of global stocks by midcentury, higher economic returns, and greater robustness to environmental surprises. These results challenge the consensus that global fisheries can be rebuilt by existing approaches alone, while also underscoring that rebuilding stocks may still be achieved by improved decision-making tools that optimally manage this uncertainty.},

abstract = {Many important ecological questions require accounting for spatial variation in demographic rates (e.g., survival) and population variables (e.g., abundance per unit area). However, ecologists have few spatial modelling approaches that (i) fit directly to spatially referenced data, (ii) represent population dynamics explicitly and mechanistically, and (iii) estimate parameters using rigorous statistical methods. We therefore demonstrate a new and computationally efficient approach to spatial modelling that uses random fields in place of the random variables typically used in spatially aggregated models. We adapt this approach to delay-difference dynamics to estimate the impact of fishing and natural mortality, recruitment, and individual growth on spatial population dynamics for a fish population. In particular, we develop this approach to estimate spatial variation in average production of juvenile fishes (termed recruitment), as well as annual variation in the spatial distribution of recruitment. We first use a simulation experiment to demonstrate that the spatial delay-difference model can, in some cases, explain over 50% of spatial variance in recruitment. We also apply the spatial delay-difference model to data for rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) in the Gulf of Alaska and show that average recruitment (across all years) is greatest near Kodiak Island but that some years show greatest recruitment in Southeast Alaska or the western Gulf of Alaska. Using model developments and software advances presented here, we argue that future research can develop models to approximate adult movement, incorporate spatial covariates to explain annual variation in recruitment, and evaluate management procedures that use spatially explicit estimates of population abundance.},

abstract = {Ontogeny of diving and foraging behavior in marine top predators is poorly understood despite its importance in population recruitment. This lack of knowledge is partly due to the difficulties of monitoring juveniles in the wild, which is linked to high mortality early in life. Pinnipeds are good models for studying the development of foraging behaviors because juveniles are large enough to robustly carry tracking devices for many months. Moreover, parental assistance is absent after a juvenile departs for its first foraging trip, minimizing confounding effects of parental input on the development of foraging skills. In this study, we tracked 20 newly weaned juvenile southern elephant seals from Kerguelen Islands for up to 338 days during their first trip at sea following weaning. We used a new generation of satellite relay tags, which allow for the transmission of dive, accelerometer, and location data. We also monitored, at the same time, nine adult females from the colony during their post-breeding trips, in order to compare diving and foraging behaviors. Juveniles showed a gradual improvement through time in their foraging skills. Like adults females, they remarkably adjusted their swimming effort according to temporal changes in buoyancy (i.e., a proxy of their body condition). They also did not appear to exceed their aerobic physiological diving limits, although dives were constrained by their smaller size compared to adults. Changes in buoyancy appeared to also influence their decision to either keep foraging or return to land, alongside the duration of their haul outs and choice of foraging habitat (oceanic vs. plateau). Further studies are thus needed to better understand how patterns in juveniles survival, and therefore elephant seal populations, might be affected by their changes in foraging skills and changes in their environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Shallow-diving, coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and deep-diving, pelagic pygmy and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia breviceps and K. sima) will experience vastly different ambient pressures at depth, which will influence the volume of air within their lungs and potentially the degree of thoracic collapse they experience. This study tested the hypotheses that lung size will be reduced and/or thoracic mobility will be enhanced in deeper divers. Lung mass (T. truncatus, n = 106; kogiids, n = 18) and lung volume (T. truncatus, n = 5; kogiids, n = 4), relative to total body mass, were compared. One T. truncatus and one K. sima were cross-sectioned to calculate lung, thoracic vasculature, and other organ volumes. Excised thoraxes (T. truncatus, n = 3; kogiids, n = 4) were mechanically manipulated to compare changes in thoracic cavity shape and volume. Kogiid lungs were half the mass and one-fifth the volume of those of similarly sized T. truncatus. The lungs occupied only 15% of the total thoracic cavity volume in K. sima and 37% in T. truncatus. The kogiid and dolphin thoraxes underwent similar changes in shape and volume, although the width of the thoracic inlet was relatively constrained in kogiids. A broader phylogenetic comparison demonstrated that the ratio of lung mass to total body mass in kogiids, physeterids, and ziphiids was similar to that of terrestrial mammals, while delphinids and phocoenids possessed relatively large lungs. Thus, small lung size in deep-diving odontocetes may be a plesiomorphic character. The relatively large lung size of delphinids and phocoenids appears to be a derived condition that may permit the lung to function as a site of respiratory gas exchange throughout a dive in these rapid breathing, short-duration, shallow divers.},

abstract = {Ocean climate impacts on survivorship and growth of Atlantic salmon are complex, but still poorly understood. Stock abundances have declined over the past three decades and 1992-2006 has seen widespread sea surface temperature (SST) warming of the NE Atlantic, including the foraging areas exploited by salmon of southern European origin. Salmon cease feeding on return migration, and here we express the final growth condition of year-classes of one-sea winter adults at, or just before, freshwater re-entry as the predicted weight at standard length. Two independent 14-year time series for a single river stock and for mixed, multiple stocks revealed almost identical temporal patterns in growth condition variation, and an overall trend decrease of 11-14% over the past decade. Growth condition has fallen as SST anomaly has risen, and for each year-class the midwinter (January) SST anomalies they experienced at sea correlated negatively with their final condition on migratory return during the subsequent summer months. Stored lipids are crucial for survival and for the prespawning provisioning of eggs in freshwater, and we show that under-weight individuals have disproportionately low reserves. The poorest condition fish (similar to 30% under-weight) returned with lipid stores reduced by similar to 80%. This study concurs with previous analyses of other North Atlantic top consumers (e.g. somatic condition of tuna, reproductive failure of seabirds) showing evidence of major, recent climate-driven changes in the eastern North Atlantic pelagic ecosystem, and the likely importance of bottom-up control processes. Because salmon abundances presently remain at historical lows, fecundity of recent year-classes will have been increasingly compromised. Measures of year-class growth condition should therefore be incorporated in the analysis and setting of numerical spawning escapements for threatened stocks, and conservation limits should be revised upwards conservatively during periods of excessive ocean climate warming.},

abstract = {To fully understand how diving seabirds and marine mammals balance the potentially conflicting demands of holding their breath while living their lives underwater (and maintaining physiological homeostasis during exercise, feeding, growth, and reproduction), physiological studies must be conducted with animals in their natural environments. The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or “biologging”, has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). With a variety of approaches and high demand for data on the physiology of diving seabirds and marine mammals, the future of field studies is bright.},

abstract = {Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.},

Thereafter travel was interrupted by bouts of slower travel or stationary phases. The latter were localized at sites on the continental shelf or along its edge. Three seals that were tracked over more than one season repeated their outward direction of travel and used some of the same sites in subsequent years.

We investigated trends in spatial pattern across the forest-tundra ecotone and geographical variation in the Yukon, Manitoba, and Labrador, Canada. Tree cover was measured in contiguous quadrats along transects up to 100 m long located in Forest, Ecotone, and Tundra sections across the forest-tundra transition. Spatial patterns were analyzed using new local variance to estimate patch size and wavelet analysis to determine the scale and amount of aggregation. Compared with the Forest, tree cover in the Ecotone was less aggregated at most sites, with fewer smaller patches of trees. We found evidence that shorter trees may be clumped at some sites, perhaps due to shelter from the wind, and we found little support for regular spacing that would indicate competition. With climate change, trees in the Ecotone will likely become more aggregated as patches enlarge and new patches establish. However, results were site-specific, varying with aspect and the presence of krummholz (stunted trees); therefore, strategies for adaptation of communities to climate change in Canada's subarctic forest would need to reflect these differences.},

abstract = {Abundant large herbivores can strongly alter vegetation composition, shifting the ecosystem into a lasting state of changed productivity. Previous studies of the effects of abundant reindeer on alpine and arctic vegetation have yielded equivocal results, probably due to differing environmental contexts. To overcome context dependency we devised a large-scale survey in the region of Finnmark, northern Norway, possessing some of the most densely stocked reindeer herds in the world. The effects of reindeer abundance on summer pasture vegetation were assessed by employing a quasi-experimental design, including site fertility as a potential modifier of the reindeer-vegetation interaction. The study design comprised ten pairs of neighboring management districts (encompassing 18,003 km(2)), where over the two last decades a high-density district on average had reindeer densities more than twice as high and calf weights consistently lower than the low-density district. The abundance of different plant functional groups, ranging from those having facilitating to retarding effects on ecosystem productivity, were quantified by the point intercept method on plots selected according to a hierarchical, stratified random sampling design. Species with strong retarding effects on ecosystem productivity (for example, ericoids) were by far the most abundant. However, we found no consistent effects of reindeer density on their abundance. The most consistent differences between high- and low-density districts were found in plant functional groups with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity. In particular, the abundance of N-facilitators, large dicotyledons and grasses were substantially reduced in the high-density districts. However, this reduction was restricted to fertile sites. Thus, reindeer when present at high densities have homogenized the biomass of palatable plants across environmental productivity gradients according to predictions from exploitation ecosystem models. Such reduction of plants with facilitating to neutral effects on ecosystem productivity indicates a reduced state of ecosystem productivity in high-density districts.},

abstract = {Animals live in an environment that is patchy and hierarchical. I present a method of detecting the scales at which animals perceive their world. The hierarchical nature of habitat causes movement path structure to vary with spatial scale, and the patchy nature of habitat causes movement path structure to vary throughout space. These responses can be measured by a combination of path tortuousity (measured with fractal dimension) versus spatial scale, the variation in tortuousity of small path segments along the movement path, and the correlation between tortuousities of adjacent path segments. These statistics were tested using simulated animal movements. When movement paths contained no spatial heterogeneity, then fractal D and variance continuously increased with scale, and correlation was zero at all scales. When movement paths contained spatial heterogeneity, then fractal D sometimes showed a discontinuity at transitions between domains of scale, variation showed peaks at transitions, and correlations showed a statistically significant positive value at scales smaller than patch size, decreasing to below zero at scales greater than patch size. I illustrated these techniques with movement paths from deer mice and red-backed voles. These new analyses should help understand how animals perceive and react to their landscape structure at various spatial scales, and to answer questions about how habitat structure affects animal movement patterns.},

abstract = {Foraging behaviour of marine predators inferred from the analysis of horizontal or vertical movements commonly lack quantitative information about foraging success. Several marine mammal species are known to perform dives where they passively drift in the water column, termed “drift” dives. The drift rate is determined by the animal's buoyancy, which can be used to make inference regarding body condition. Long term dive records retrieved via satellite uplink are often summarized before transmission. This loss of resolution hampers identification of drift dives. Here, we develop a flexible, hierarchically structured approach to identify drift dives and estimate the drift rate from the summarized time-depth profiles that are increasingly available to the global research community. Based on high-resolution dive data from southern elephant seals, we classify dives as drift/non-drift and apply a summarization algorithm. We then (i) automatically generate dive groups based on inflection point ordering using a ‘Reverse' Broken-Stick Algorithm, (ii) develop a set of threshold criteria to apply across groups, ensuring non-drift dives are most efficiently rejected, and (iii) finally implement a custom Kalman filter to retain the remaining dives that are within the seals estimated drifting time series. Validation with independent data sets shows our method retains approximately 3% of all dives, of which 88% are true drift dives. The drift rate estimates are unbiased, with the upper 95% quantile of the mean squared error between the daily averaged summarized profiles using our method (SDDR) and the observed daily averaged drift rate (ODDR) being only 0.0015. The trend of the drifting time-series match expectations for capital breeders, showing the lowest body condition commencing foraging trips and a progressive improvement as they remain at sea. Our method offers sufficient resolution to track small changes in body condition at a fine temporal scale. This approach overcomes a long-term challenge for large existing and ongoing data collections, with potential application across other drift diving species. Enabling robust identification of foraging success at sea offers a rare and valuable opportunity for monitoring marine ecosystem productivity in space and time by tracking the success of a top predator.},

However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

abstract = {Obtaining direct measurements to characterise ecosystem function can be hindered by remote or inaccessible regions. Next-generation satellite tags that inform increasingly sophisticated movement models, and the miniaturisation of animal-borne loggers, have enabled the use of animals as tools to collect habitat data in remote environments, such as the Southern Ocean. Research on the distribution, habitat use and recovery of Oceania's humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) has been constrained by the inaccessibility to their Antarctic feeding grounds and the limitations of technology. In this multi-disciplinary study, we combine innovative analytical tools to comprehensively assess the distribution and population structure of this marine predator throughout their entire migratory range. We used genotype and photo-identification matches and conducted a genetic mixed-stock analysis to identify the breeding ground origins of humpback whales migrating past the Kermadec Islands, New Zealand. Satellite tracking data and a state-space model were then used to identify the migratory paths and behaviour of 18 whales, and to reveal their Antarctic feeding ground destinations. Additionally, we conducted progesterone assays and epigenetic aging to determine the pregnancy rate and age-profile of the population. Humpback whales passing the Kermadec Islands did not assign to a single breeding ground origin, but instead came from a range of breeding grounds spanning ∼3500 km of ocean. Sampled whales ranged from calves to adults of up to 67 years of age, and a pregnancy rate of 57% was estimated from 30 adult females. The whales migrated to the Southern Ocean (straight-line distances of up to 7000 km) and spanned ∼4500 km across their Antarctic feeding grounds. All fully tracked females with a dependent calf (n = 4) migrated to the Ross Sea region, while 70% of adults without calves (n = 7) travelled further east to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas region. By combining multiple research and analytical tools we obtained a comprehensive understanding of this wide-ranging, remote population of whales. Our results indicate a population recovering from exploitation, and their feeding ground distribution serves as an indicator of the resources available in these environments. The unexpected Kermadec Islands migratory bottle-neck of whales from several breeding grounds, variable distribution patterns by life history stage and high pregnancy rates will be important in informing conservation and management planning, and for understanding how this, as well as other whale populations, might respond to emerging threats such as climate change.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain and predict the behaviour of air-breathing divers exploiting a food resource underwater. Many field observations of the behaviour of divers do not fit with the prediction that to maximize energetic gain divers should dive close to their aerobic diving limits. In an attempt to explain this paradox, Thompson & Fedak (2001, Animal Behaviour, 61, 286–297) proposed a model of diving behaviour that takes into account patchily distributed prey patches of varying quality. We tested this model experimentally in a simulated foraging set-up. We measured the diving behaviour of grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, diving to patches of varying prey density and distance from the surface. Our results were equivocal with respect to the model predictions. Seals responded to prey density, leaving low-quality patches earlier. However, this pattern was still evident at long dive distances, contrary to the prediction that during deep dives seals should stay at a patch regardless of prey density. While seals maximized dive durations at high prey densities and long distances, they did not do so at short distances. The apparent quitting strategy of the seals always produced higher net rates of energy gain than would have been achieved if they had remained at the foraging site up to their aerobic dive limit on every dive. These results indicate that seals' diving behaviour, particularly bottom duration, may indicate the relative prey availability in their environment.},

The trajectories of two drifters drogued at a depth of 120 m revealed a pair of counterrotating mesoscale eddies attached to the leeside of Ojin/Jingu Seamount in the summer of 1992. The eddies had diameters of 75{\^{a}}€“100 km and rotational speeds of 20{\^{a}}€“40 cm/s at 120 m. Sea surface height anomalies derived from blended TOPEX/ERS-1 satellite altimetry revealed that the eddies had a surface manifestation as well. One of the drifters made five loops within the cyclonic eddy over a period of 62 days, during which time the eddy translated westward, toward the seamount, at 2.9 cm/s. This is one of the first observations demonstrating an extended attachment of a topographically generated eddy to a seamount. Drifters drogued at a depth of 15 m which crossed the ESC in the summer of 1991 and winter of 1993 revealed no eddy activity, most likely because of a decoupling of the topographic influence to the 15 m flow at their crossing latitude over the Nintoku Seamount (summit depth at 1000 m). The implication is that eddy formation within the mixed layer near the ESC is confined to the region around the taller Ojin/Jingu and Kinmei Seamounts (summit depths at 800 m and 100 m, respectively). It is suggested that long-lived eddies attached to the leeside of the ESC can profoundly influence local biological production and water exchange between the western and eastern basins of the North Pacific.},

abstract = {Polar regions are particularly sensitive to climate change, with the potential for significant feedbacks between ocean circulation, sea ice, and the ocean carbon cycle. However, the difficulty in obtaining in situ data means that our ability to detect and interpret change is very limited, especially in the Southern Ocean, where the ocean beneath the sea ice remains almost entirely unobserved and the rate of sea-ice formation is poorly known. Here, we show that southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) equipped with oceanographic sensors can measure ocean structure and water mass changes in regions and seasons rarely observed with traditional oceanographic platforms. In particular, seals provided a 30-fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea-ice zone, allowing the major fronts to be mapped south of 60 degrees S and sea-ice formation rates to be inferred from changes in upper ocean salinity. Sea-ice production rates peaked in early winter (April-May) during the rapid northward expansion of the pack ice and declined by a factor of 2 to 3 between May and August, in agreement with a three-dimensional coupled ocean-sea-ice model. By measuring the high-latitude ocean during winter, elephant seals fill a "blind spot" in our sampling coverage, enabling the establishment of a truly global ocean-observing system.},

abstract = {It has previously been asserted that baleen whales compete with fisheries by consuming potentially harvestable marine resources. The regularly applied "surplus-yield model" suggests that whale prey becomes available to fisheries if whales are removed, and has been presented as a justification for whaling. However, recent findings indicate that whales enhance ecosystem productivity by defecating iron that stimulates primary productivity in iron-limited waters. While juvenile whales and whales that are pregnant or lactating retain iron for growth and milk production, nonbreeding adult whales defecate most of the iron they consume. Here, we modify the surplus-yield model to incorporate iron defecation. After modeling a simplistic trajectory of blue whale recovery to historical abundances, the traditional surplus-yield model predicts that 1011 kg of carbon yr-1 would become unavailable to fisheries. However, this ignores the nutrient recycling role of whales. Our model suggests the population of blue whales would defecate 3 × 106 kg of iron yr-1, which would stimulate primary production equivalent to that required to support prey consumption by the blue whale population. Thus, modifying the surplus-yield model to include iron defecation indicates that blue whales do not render marine resources unavailable to fisheries. By defecating iron-rich feces, blue whales promote Southern Ocean productivity, rather than reducing fishery yields. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

abstract = {Following centuries of exploitation, basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) are considered by IUCN as Endangered in the Northeast Atlantic, where they have now been substantially protected for over two decades. However, the present size of this population remains unknown. We investigated the use of photo-identification of individuals' dorsal fins, combined with mark-recapture methodology, to investigate the size of populations of basking shark within the west coast of Scotland. From a total of 921 encounters photographed between 2004 and 2011, 710 sharks were found to be individually identifiable based on dorsal fin damage and natural features. Of these, only 41 individuals were re-sighted, most commonly both within days of, and close to the site of, the initial encounter. A smaller number were re-sighted after longer periods of up to two years. A comparison of the distinguishing features of individuals on first recording and subsequent re-sighting showed that in almost all cases these features remained little changed, suggesting the low re-sighting rate was not due to a loss of distinguishing features. Because of the low number of re-sighting we were not able to produce reliable estimates for the long-term regional population. However, for one 50 km diameter study area between the islands of Mull, Coll and Tiree, we were able to generate closed-population estimates for 6-9 day periods in 2010 of 985 (95% CI = 494-1683), and in 2011 of 201 (95% CI = 143-340). For the same 2011 period an open-population model generated a similar estimate of 213 (95% CI = 111-317). Otherwise the low rate and temporal patterning of re-sightings support the view that such local basking shark populations are temporary, dynamic groupings of individuals drawn from a much larger regional population than previously supposed. The study demonstrated the feasibility and limitations of photo-identification as a non-invasive technique for identifying individual basking sharks.},

abstract = {Mature female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) come ashore only in October to breed and in January to moult, spending the rest of the year foraging at sea. Mature females may lose as much as 50% of their body mass, mostly in lipid stores, during the breeding season due to fasting and lactation. When departing to sea, post-breeding females are negatively buoyant, and the relative change in body condition (i.e. density) during the foraging trip has previously been assessed by monitoring the descent rate during drift dives. However, relatively few drift dives are performed, resulting in low resolution of the temporal reconstruction of body condition change. In this study, six post-breeding females were equipped with time-depth recorders and accelerometers to investigate whether changes in active swimming effort and speed could be used as an alternative method of monitoring density variations throughout the foraging trip. In addition, we assessed the consequences of density change on the swimming efforts of individuals while diving and investigated the effects on dive duration. Both descent swimming speed and ascent swimming effort were found to be strongly correlated to descent rate during drift dives, enabling the fine-scale monitoring of seal density change over the whole trip. Negatively buoyant seals minimized swimming effort during descents, gliding down at slower speeds, and reduced their ascent swimming effort to maintain a nearly constant swimming speed as their buoyancy increased. One per cent of seal density variation over time was found to induce a 20% variation in swimming effort during dives with direct consequences on dive duration.},

abstract = {The region Finnmark, in northernmost Europe, harbors dense populations of semi-domestic reindeer of which some exhibit characteristics of overabundance. Whereas overabundance is evident in terms of density-dependent reductions in reindeer body mass, population growth and abundance of forage plants, claims have been made that this reindeer overabundance also has caused a trophic cascade. These claims are based on the main premise that reindeer overgrazing negatively impacts small-sized, keystone tundra herbivores. We tested this premise by a large-scale study in which the abundance of small rodents, hares and ptarmigans was indexed across reindeer management districts with strong differences in stocking densities. We examined the scale-dependent relations between reindeer, vegetation and these small-sized herbivores by employing a spatially hierarchical sampling design within the management districts. A negative impact of reindeer on ptarmigan, probably as a result of browsing reducing tall Salix, was indicated. However, small rodents (voles and lemmings), which are usually the keystone herbivores in the plant-based tundra food web, were not negatively impacted. On the contrary, there was a strong positive relationship between small rodents and reindeer, both at the scale of landscape areas and local patches, with characteristics of snow-bed vegetation, suggesting facilitation between Norwegian lemmings and reindeer. We conclude that the recent dampening of the vole and lemming population cycle with concurrent declines of rodent predators in northernmost Europe were not caused by large herbivore overgrazing.},

abstract = {Long-term demographic studies have recently shown that global climate change together with increasing direct impacts of human activities, such as fisheries, are affecting the population dynamics of marine top predators. However, the effects of these factors on species distribution and abundance at sea are still poorly understood, particularly in marine ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. Using a unique long-term data set of at-sea observations, we tested for interdecadal (1980s vs. 2000s) changes in summer abundance and distribution of 12 species of Albatrosses and Petrels along a 30° latitudinal gradient between tropical and Antarctic waters of the southern Indian Ocean. There were contrasting effects of climate change on subantarctic seabird distribution and abundance at sea. While subtropical waters showed the highest rate of warming, the species that visited this water mass showed the greatest changes in distribution and abundance. The abundance of Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), White-chinned Petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and Giant Petrels (Macronectes sp.) declined markedly, whereas the other species showed contrasting trends or did not change. With the exception of the White-chinned Petrel, these decreases were at least partly related to regional increase in sea surface temperature. The southward shift of Wandering Albatross and Prions (Pachyptila spp.) distributions could be ascribed to species redistribution or decrease in abundance due to warming of the subtropical waters. Surprisingly, White-chinned Petrel distribution shifted northward, suggesting more complex mechanisms. This study is the first to document a shift in species range in the Southern Ocean related to climate change and contrasting abundance changes. It suggests that some species might experience more severe impacts from climate change depending on the water masses they visit. As climate changes are predicted to continue in the next decades, understanding species responses to climate change is crucial for conservation management, especially when their conservation status is critical or unknown. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Humans have reduced the abundance of many large marine vertebrates, including whales, large fish, and sharks, to only a small percentage of their pre-exploitation levels. Industrial fishing and whaling also tended to preferentially harvest the largest species and largest individuals within a population. We consider the consequences of removing these animals on the ocean's ability to store carbon. Methodology/Principal Findings: Because body size is critical to our arguments, our analysis focuses on populations of baleen whales. Using reconstructions of pre-whaling and modern abundances, we consider the impact of whaling on the amount of carbon stored in living whales and on the amount of carbon exported to the deep sea by sinking whale carcasses. Populations of large baleen whales now store 9.16106 tons less carbon than before whaling. Some of the lost storage has been offset by increases in smaller competitors; however, due to the relative metabolic efficiency of larger organisms, a shift toward smaller animals could decrease the total community biomass by 30% or more. Because of their large size and few predators, whales and other large marine vertebrates can efficiently export carbon from the surface waters to the deep sea.We estimate that rebuilding whale populations would remove 1.66105 tons of carbon each year through sinking whale carcasses. Conclusions/Significance: Even though fish and whales are only a small portion of the ocean's overall biomass, fishing and whaling have altered the ocean's ability to store and sequester carbon. Although these changes are small relative to the total ocean carbon sink, rebuilding populations of fish and whales would be comparable to other carbon management schemes, including ocean iron fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Pershing et al.},

abstract = {Studies on diving behaviour classically divide a dive into three phases: the descent, bottom and ascent phases, with foraging assumed to occur during the bottom phase. The greater complexity of dive revealed through modern, high resolution data highlights the need to re-assess this approach and to consider a larger number of phases within individual dives. Two southern elephant seals (SES) were fitted with a head mounted Time Depth Recorder (TDR) and an accelerometer from which prey capture attempts were estimated. A Weddell seal was also fitted with a TDR. TDRs for both species recorded depth once per second. We quantified the within dive behaviour using an automated broken stick algorithm identifying the optimal number of segments within each dive. The vertical sinuosity of the segments was used to infer two types of behaviours, with highly sinuous segments indicating "hunting" and less sinuous segments indicating "transiting". Using the broken stick method the seals alternated between "hunting" and "transit" modes with an average of 6±2 and 7±0.02 behavioural phases within each dive for the Weddell seal and SES, respectively. In SES, 77% of prey capture attempts (identified from the acceleration data) occurred in highly sinuous phases ("hunting") as defined by our new approach. SES spent more time in transit mode within a dive, and hunting mostly occurred during the bottom phase. Conversely the Weddell seal spent more time in hunting mode which also occurred during bottom phase but occurred mostly at shallower depths. Such differences probably reflect different foraging tactics and habitat use. For both species, hunting time differs significantly from bottom time previously used as a proxy for the time spent foraging in a dive. The hunting time defined by our method therefore provides a more accurate fine-scale description of the seals' foraging behaviour.},

Expert judgement is used to link these impacts to changes in vital rates and applied to population models that compare population changes under baseline and construction scenarios over a 25. year period.

Combining multibeam-sonar and multifrequency-echosounder data: examples of the analysis and imaging of large euphausiid schools. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 000-000. The first high-resolution, quantitative, multibeam sonar (Simrad MS70) ever developed was mounted in a keel of RV "G. O. Sars" with port-orientated beams. Each ping samples a volume of 60{degrees} horizontally x 45{degrees} vertically with 500 beams, which is often enough to insonify a complete school of fish or zooplankton. The large amount of resulting data is efficiently preprocessed with automatic, real-time detections of school candidates; these are accepted or rejected during post-processing. The system was used on the continental shelf near the Subantarctic island of South Georgia to study Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and some of the detected schools were immediately sampled with a six-frequency echosounder (Simrad EK60), then trawled with various nets to verify the target species and their size composition. For schools acoustically categorized as euphausiids, data from the two acoustic systems were used to estimate the school morphometrics and the krill size distributions. The principal objectives of this study were to explore the potential of combining data from a multibeam sonar, multifrequency echosounders, and nets, and to describe the efficient processing methods and software that facilitate the multi-instrument analyses. Three-dimensional morphometrics based on the MS70 data were consistent with corresponding two-dimensional morphometrics based on the echosounder data and could be used to improve the acoustic classifications of taxa or species. Additionally, automatic preprocessing and integration of data from different sources into the same user interface allowed efficient exploration and interpretation of all the acoustic data.},

One helicopter, operated from the applied expedition vessel, flew reconnaissance flights, monitored the distribution of seal patches and performed age-staging of the pups. The total estimate of hooded seal pup production was 16 140 (SE = 2 140, CV = 13.3%), which is similar to an estimate obtained for comparable surveys in 2005. The total pup production estimate obtained for harp seals was 110 530 (SE = 27 680, CV = 25.0%), which is slightly higher than an estimate obtained for a similar survey in 2002. The pup production and the uncertainty of the pup production estimate were estimated using a standard method for analyzing this type of survey data and a recently developed method that utilized Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Using the two estimation methods on data from all three surveys (2002, 2005, 2007), comparable estimates of pup production were obtained. In scenarios where pups were clustered, the estimated uncertainty of the pup production estimate was much lower for the GAM method than for the conventional method. This resulted in a considerable reduction of the estimated coefficient of variation. In scenarios where pups were uniformly distributed, both methods performed the same.},

abstract = {Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26% (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more 'wiggles' and 'dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.},

Data were collected from 10 foraging whales using non-invasive archival tags that simultaneously recorded underwater movements and the acoustic environment at the whale. Using mixed models, we assess the effects of ship noise on seven parameters of their feeding behaviours. Independent variables included the presence or absence of ship noise and the received level of ship noise at the whale. We found significant effects on foraging, including slower descent rates and fewer side-roll feeding events per dive with increasing ship noise. During 5 of 18 ship passages, dives without side-rolls were observed. These findings indicate that humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, an area with chronically elevated levels of shipping traffic, significantly change foraging activity when exposed to high levels of ship noise. This measureable reduction in within-dive foraging effort of individual whales could potentially lead to population-level impacts of shipping noise on baleen whale foraging success.},

abstract = {It has been predicted that geometrically similar animals would swim at the same speed with stroke frequency scaling with mass(-1/3). In the present study, morphological and behavioural data obtained from free-ranging penguins (seven species) were compared. Morphological measurements support the geometrical similarity. However, cruising speeds of 1.8-2.3 m s(-1) were significantly related to mass(0.08) and stroke frequencies were proportional to mass(-0.29). These scaling relationships do not agree with the previous predictions for geometrically similar animals. We propose a theoretical model, considering metabolic cost, work against mechanical forces (drag and buoyancy), pitch angle and dive depth. This new model predicts that: (i) the optimal swim speed, which minimizes the energy cost of transport, is proportional to (basal metabolic rate/drag)(1/3) independent of buoyancy, pitch angle and dive depth; (ii) the optimal speed is related to mass(0.05); and (iii) stroke frequency is proportional to mass(-0.28). The observed scaling relationships of penguins support these predictions, which suggest that breath-hold divers swam optimally to minimize the cost of transport, including mechanical and metabolic energy during dive.},

abstract = {A combination of scientific, economic, technological and policy drivers is behind a recent upsurge in the use of marine autonomous systems (and accompanying miniaturized sensors) for environmental mapping and monitoring. Increased spatial-temporal resolution and coverage of data, at reduced cost, is particularly vital for effective spatial management of highly dynamic and heterogeneous shelf environments. This proof-of-concept study involves integration of a novel combination of sensors onto buoyancy-driven submarine gliders, in order to assess their suitability for ecosystem monitoring in shelf waters at a variety of trophic levels. Two shallow-water Slocum gliders were equipped with CTD and fluorometer to measure physical properties and chlorophyll, respectively. One glider was also equipped with a single-frequency echosounder to collect information on zooplankton and fish distribution. The other glider carried a Passive Acoustic Monitoring system to detect and record cetacean vocalizations, and a passive sampler to detect chemical contaminants in the water column. The two gliders were deployed together off southwest UK in autumn 2013, and targeted a known tidal-mixing front west of the Isles of Scilly. The gliders' mission took about 40 days, with each glider travelling distances of >1000km and undertaking >2500 dives to depths of up to 100m. Controlling glider flight and alignment of the two glider trajectories proved to be particularly challenging due to strong tidal flows. However, the gliders continued to collect data in poor weather when an accompanying research vessel was unable to operate. In addition, all glider sensors generated useful data, with particularly interesting initial results relating to subsurface chlorophyll maxima and numerous fish/cetacean detections within the water column. The broader implications of this study for marine ecosystem monitoring with submarine gliders are discussed.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being recognized as potentially useful for detection of marine mammals in their natural habitats, but an important consideration is the associated uncertainties in animal detection.We present a study based on field trials using UAVs to carry out image- based monitoring of cetaceans in two fjords in northern Norway. We conducted 12 missions to assess the effects of both environmental- and aircraft-related variables on detection certainty. Images were inspected for animal presence and its associated detection certainty. Images were also assessed for potentially impor- tant covariates such as wave turbulence (sea state), luminance, and glare. Aircraft variables such as alti- tude, pitch, and roll were combined into a single variable—pixel size.We recorded a total of 50 humpback whales, 63 killer whales (KW), and 118 unidentified sightings.We also recorded 57 harbor porpoise sight- ings. None of the environmental conditions (sea state, glare, and luminance) affected the detection cer- tainty of harbor porpoises. In contrast, increasing sea state and luminance had negative and positive effects, respectively, on the detection certainty of humpback and KW. The detection certainty was not sig- nificantly affected by pixel size for both harbor porpoises, and humpback and KW. Our results indicate that at lower altitudes, variations in aircraft position (pitch and roll) do not have a variable effect on detec- tion certainty. Overall, this study shows the importance of measuring variability in both environmental and flight-related variables, in order to attain unbiased estimates of detectability for UAV-based marine mammal surveys, particularly in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.},

abstract = {The requirements for polar oceanographic data are expanding rapidly with demands increasing for higher spatial and temporal resolution and also for near real-time monitoring of ocean processes. The IPY will add challenges to ocean observation with its emphasis on under sampled, logistically difficult Polar Regions. Recent developments in sampling and data retrieval devices and improved knowledge of marine mammal behaviour have provided a new approach for ocean observation. The SMRU have developed Satellite Relayed Data Loggers (SRDLs) with integrated CTD. These are attached to marine mammals that move freely throughout the polar oceans diving repeatedly, even in regions of heavy ice cover. Because of their unique diving abilities, seals can provide CTD profiles to depths to 2000 m. The SRDL carries specially designed sensors (Valeport Ltd) that use a PRT for temperature and an inductive cell for conductivity measurements. When user-specified conditions of time and depth are met, the SRDLs software responds by detecting the deepest point of a dive, and then initiating rapid sampling of temperature, conductivity and depth throughout the ascent. A combination of predefined depths and inflection points from a broken stick algorithm are then used to provide 20 depth-temperature-conductivity points, which are relayed and located using System Argos. Concurrent records of dive times, depth profiles and swim speeds are also sent, providing detailed records of the animals behaviour. The recent SeaOS project (Southern Elephant seals as Oceanographic Samplershttp:// www.smru.st-and.ac.uk/research/SEaOS/SEaOS.htm) brought together oceanographers and biologists from France, Australia, US and UK to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Between 2003 and 2005, SEaOS tracked elephant seals from Macquarie, Kerguelen, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula throughout their winter migrations. The seals ranged widely across the entire Southern Ocean, collectively circling the globe. Each animal relayed data for an average 160 (max 315) days (10276 seal days at sea), providing cross-sectional samples along and across the main circum-Antarctic fronts and water masses. We also obtained long temporal series in the seals chosen foraging areas, ranging from the Subtropical Convergences down to areas deep within the marginal ice zone. The seals have contributed extensive oceanographic temperature and salinity data from places and seasons that were previously extremely data sparse, while simultaneously providing new insights into how the seals utilize their deep ocean environment. The multinational IPY project, MEOP (Marine Mammal Exploration of the Oceans Pole to Pole) proposes to apply this approach during 2007/08. Thanks to these technological developments in data collection, storage and communication, the "50th anniversary celebration" of the IGY will have the polar animals themselves as part of the exploratory team and synergistically combine oceanographic and biological studies},

abstract = {Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.},

abstract = {The roles of the marine national park of the Iroise Sea (France) are to maintain marine biodiversity, including the southernmost grey seal colony in the Eastern Atlantic, whilst managing sustainable human activities. This study compares the fish biomass taken by local seals and the landings by man in the Iroise Sea. Sixteen seals were satellite tracked from 1999 and 2003, providing location and behavioural (diving) data from which foraging locations were estimated. One individual spent a third of its foraging time in direct, long distance trips (200–350 km) across the English Channel, but most seals spent the majority (68.5%) of their foraging time in the Iroise Sea, making return trips within 30 km of their departure haulout sites. The energetic consumption of the seal colony, taking sex and age classes into account, was assessed and combined with seal abundance estimates and dietary data to assess the total prey consumption by seals, for each prey species. We estimated that during the study period, the grey seal colony in the Iroise Sea consumed around 115 tons of fish per year. The main source of uncertainty of this calculation came from the confidence intervals in total seal abundance estimates. This consumption comprised 13.6 tons of sea bass, 4.3 tons of pollack and 2.7 tons of sole, representing 16.4, 1.8, and 5.2% of landings in the same areas for these three fish species, respectively. Within the four ICES rectangles where grey seals foraged, overlap between seals and fisheries was greatest in rectangle 25E5 (72.7% of all foraging dives), where grey seals haul out, and less in rectangles 25E4 (11.7%), 26E5 (10.8%), and 26E4 (4.8%).},

Low altitude, long endurance systems are still highly priced. Regulatory bodies also impose limitations while struggling to cope with UAS rapid technological evolution. In contrast, small vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS have become increasingly affordable but lack the flight endurance required for long-range aerial surveys.

The present note represents a general overview on the use of UAS as a survey tool for marine mammal studies. The literature pertaining to UAS marine mammal research applications is considered with special concern for advantages and limitations of the survey design.

abstract = {The main aim of our long-term study on the at-sea distribution of the upper trophic levels in polar marine ecosystems is to deepen the understanding of the basic mechanisms affecting their distribution, i.e. hydrological factors such as water masses and fronts, pack ice and ice edge, eddies. A second goal consists in detecting spatial and temporal changes, with special attention to global climate changes, as well as possible consequences of (krill) fisheries. Seabirds and marine mammals were recorded during an autumn expedition of icebreaking RV Polarstern between Punta Arenas and the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica in March/ April 2012. During a total of 333 half-an-hour transect counts without width limitation, 113,500 seabirds were encountered, belonging to 40 species. The vast majority were southern fulmars and grey-headed albatross around the South Shetland Islands, with 76,800 and 7,000 individuals, respectively. Fin whale was by far the most abundant cetacean with 300 identified individuals in the same area, of which 100 in one count. These exceptional concentrations of fin whale seem to reflect an autumn pre-migration feeding aggregation. For most species, the majority was concentrated in very few counts, reflecting a very high patchiness and, as upper trophic levels, an important prey availability-mainly krill, nekton and small fish. Low biodiversity was reflected by both the low number of species and the fact that a few species represent the vast majority in numbers. It is suggested that the area deserves future biological studies, especially in autumn, and a special protection management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Noise caused by within- and among-year variance should be minimized to optimize the statistical power for detecting changes in abundance. A total of 30 years of monitoring data from seven distinct subpopulations of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in southern Scandinavia was used to investigate the relative contributions of factors affecting the power to detect trends in abundance. The power is typically doubled under the conditions tested when carrying out annual surveys compared with every second year. The power also increases substantially when carrying out replicate surveys during the annual moult. The gain in power increases steeply up to three annual replicates, but then levels off, and it is further increased when the mean of the two highest counts of three annually repeated counts is used. We propose that harbour seal haul-out sites are surveyed every year during the moult, with at least three replicate surveys per year. This would provide robust data for analyses of population trends, facilitating management and identification of potential influences of diseases and anthropogenic activities.},

abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known for the variety and complexity of their feeding behaviors. Here we report on the use of synchronous motion and acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to provide the first detailed kinematic descriptions of humpback whales using bottom side-rolls (BSRs) to feed along the seafloor. We recorded 3,505 events from 19 animals (individual range 8-722). By animal, mean BSR duration ranged from 14.1 s to 36.2 s.; mean body roll angle from 80o to 121o, and mean pitch from 7o to 38o. The median interval between sequential BSRs, by animal, ranged from 24.0 s to 63.6 s and animals tended to maintain a consistent BSR heading during long BSR series encompassing multiple dives. BSRs were most frequent between 2200 and 0400. We identify three classes of behavior: simple side-roll, side-roll inversion, and repetitive scooping. Results indicate that BSR feeding is a common technique in the study area and there is both coordination and noncoordination between animals. We argue that this behavior is not lunge feeding as normally characterized, because animals are moving slowly through the event. The behavior also leads to vulnerability to entanglement in bottom-set fishing gear, a major mortality factor for the species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Marine Mammalogy 302 April 2014 10.1111/mms.12053 Article ARTICLES Published 2013.

abstract = {Age structure, tree characteristics, and environmental data were used to analyze the status of the birch treeline in three regions along the Scandes Mountains from 62 degrees 10'N to 69 degrees 50'N. Aspect and estimated relative radiation explained most of the treeline altitude across studied regions, but not all variation. Main tree establishment occurred during the 1940s in the southern and northernmost regions, and during the 1960s in the middle region. Age distribution patterns at 2 m (tree size), however, showed stable or possibly progressive treelines in the southern and middle regions but recent recession in the north. Growth rates varied through time and between regions, with an apparent decrease in the north since the 1940s. Weak negative correlations between attitude and age in the south indicate recent changes favoring tree growth or increased turnover at higher, more exposed altitudes. Although Scandinavian treelines are expected to advance in response to climate warming, this was not evident as a general pattern for all regions. Seasonally different climate patterns, browsing, and abrasion are mechanisms involved in this, These regionally different patterns have to be taken into account in predictions of future responses to avoid overestimation of, e.g., ecosystem change, carbon uptake capacity, and feedbacks to climate systems.},

abstract = {Many optimal foraging models for diving animals examine strategies that maximize time spent in the foraging zone, assuming that prey acquisition increases linearly with search time. Other models have considered the effect of patch quality and predict a net energetic benefit if dives where no prey is encountered early in the dive are abandoned. For deep divers, however, the energetic benefit of giving up is reduced owing to the elevated energy costs associated with descending to physiologically hostile depths, so patch residence time should be invariant. Others consider an asymptotic gain function where the decision to leave a patch is driven by patch-depletion effects - the marginal value theorem. As predator behaviour is increasingly being used as an index of marine resource density and distribution, it is important to understand the nature of this gain function. We investigated the dive behaviour of the world's deepest-diving seal, the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina, in response to patch quality. Testing these models has largely been limited to controlled experiments on captive animals. By integrating in situ measurements of the seal's relative lipid content obtained from drift rate data (a measure of foraging success) with area-restricted search behaviour identified from first-passage time analysis, we identified regions of high- and low-quality patches. Dive durations and bottom times were not invariant and did not increase in regions of high quality; rather, both were longer when patches were of relatively low quality. This is consistent with the predictions of the marginal value theorem and provides support for a nonlinear relationship between search time and prey acquisition. We also found higher descent and ascent rates in high-quality patches suggesting that seals minimized travel time to the foraging patch when quality was high; however, this was not achieved by increasing speed or dive angle. Relative body lipid content was an important predictor of dive behaviour. Seals did not schedule their diving to maximize time spent in the foraging zone in higher-quality patches, challenging the widely held view that maximizing time in the foraging zone translates to greater foraging success.},

Here, using a common garden experiment that compares replicate paired populations, we show that Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations that evolved a fast-paced life history in high-predation environments have consistently higher metabolic rates than guppies that evolved a slow-paced life history in low-predation environments. Furthermore, by transplanting guppies from high- to low-predation environments, we show that metabolic rate evolves in parallel with the pace of life history, at a rapid rate, and in the same direction as found for naturally occurring populations. Together, these multiple lines of inference provide evidence for a tight evolutionary coupling between metabolism and the pace of life history.},

abstract = {The study of animal movement and behavior is being revolutionized by technology, such as satellite tags and harmonic radar, that allows us to track the movements of individual animals. However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broader-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation techniques, all under a single statistical framework.},

Here, we conduct a series of idealized experiments with the Community Climate System Model to analyze the potential impact on boreal climate of a large-scale tundra-to-shrub conversion. The model responds to an increase in shrub abundance with substantial atmospheric heating arising from two seasonal land-atmosphere feedbacks: a decrease in surface albedo and an evapotranspiration-induced increase in atmospheric moisture content. We demonstrate that the strength and timing of these feedbacks are sensitive to shrub height and the time at which branches and leaves protrude above the snow. Taller and aerodynamically rougher shrubs lower the albedo earlier in the spring and transpire more efficiently than shorter shrubs. These mechanisms increase, in turn, the strength of the indirect sea-ice albedo and ocean evaporation feedbacks contributing to additional regional warming. Finally, we find that an invasion of tall shrubs tends to systematically warm the soil, deepen the active layer, and destabilize the permafrost (with increased formation of taliks under a future scenario) more substantially than an invasion of short shrubs.},

abstract = {Pelagic marine predators face unprecedented challenges and uncertain futures. Overexploitation and climate variability impact the abundance and distribution of top predators in ocean ecosystems. Improved understanding of ecological patterns, evolutionary constraints and ecosystem function is critical for preventing extinctions, loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystem services. Recent advances in electronic tagging techniques have provided the capacity to observe the movements and long-distance migrations of animals in relation to ocean processes across a range of ecological scales. Tagging of Pacific Predators, a field programme of the Census of Marine Life, deployed 4,306 tags on 23 species in the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in a tracking data set of unprecedented scale and species diversity that covers 265,386 tracking days from 2000 to 2009. Here we report migration pathways, link ocean features to multispecies hotspots and illustrate niche partitioning within and among congener guilds. Our results indicate that the California Current large marine ecosystem and the North Pacific transition zone attract and retain a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates. Within the California Current large marine ecosystem, several predator guilds seasonally undertake north-south migrations that may be driven by oceanic processes, species-specific thermal tolerances and shifts in prey distributions. We identify critical habitats across multinational boundaries and show that top predators exploit their environment in predictable ways, providing the foundation for spatial management of large marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of penguin energetics would represent an important contribution to our understanding of the trophodynamics of the Southern Ocean ecosystem and our ability to predict effects of environmental change on these species. We used the heart rate-rate of oxygen consumption technique to estimate rate of energy expenditure in adult king penguins raising a chick, in combination with data from the literature on changes in adult mass, chick energy requirements, and prey energy density. Our model estimated a variety of energetic costs and quantities of prey consumption related to raising a king penguin chick during the austral summer. The total energy requirements of a king penguin chick at the Crozet Archipelago from hatching until reaching a mass of 8 kg 90 d later is 271 MJ, representing the consumption of 38.4 kg of myctophid fish. A successfully breeding male requires 0.78 kg d(-1) of fish during the entirety of the incubation period and 1.14 kg d(-1) during the subsequent 90 d of chick rearing. Assuming the same energy requirements for females, the estimated 580,000 pairs of king penguins that breed successfully at Crozet each year, together with their chicks, consume a total of around 190,000 tons of fish during the incubation and summer rearing periods combined. If, due to depletion of fish stocks, the diet of breeders and chicks during the summer becomes identical to the typical diet of adults during the austral winter, the mass of prey required by both adults and chicks combined (where the chick still reaches 8 kg after 90 d) would increase by more than 25%.},

abstract = {Antarctic marine ecosystems have undergone significant changes as a result of human activities in the past and are now responding in varied and often complicated ways to climate change impacts. Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale mechanistic explanations-or "paradigms of change"-that attempt to synthesize our understanding of past and current changes. In many cases, these paradigms are based on observations that are spatially and temporally patchy. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of Earth's most rapidly changing regions, has been an area of particular research focus. A recently proposed mechanistic explanation for observed changes in the WAP region relates changes in penguin populations to variability in krill biomass and regional warming. While this scheme is attractive for its simplicity and chronology, it may not account for complex spatio-temporal processes that drive ecosystem dynamics in the region. It might also be difficult to apply to other Antarctic regions that are experiencing some, though not all, of the changes documented for the WAP. We use qualitative network models of differing levels of complexity to test paradigms of change for the WAP ecosystem. Importantly, our approach captures the emergent effects of feedback processes in complex ecological networks and provides a means to identify and incorporate uncertain linkages between network elements. Our findings highlight key areas of uncertainty in the drivers of documented trends, and suggest that a greater level of model complexity is needed in devising explanations for ecosystem change in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that our network approach to evaluating a recent and widely cited paradigm of change for the Antarctic region could be broadly applied in hypothesis testing for other regions and research fields. {\textcopyright} 2013 Melbourne-Thomas et al.},

abstract = {Understanding bird night and migration depends on field observations, theory and laboratory experiments. Like the legs of a tripod, these three elements depend on each other for support. No one leg can be extended too far beyond the others, without destabilising the structure. At the lowest level of theory is the physics of flight, which predicts the mechanical power required from the Eight muscles. The purpose of the second level is to convert the primary power requirement of the Eight muscles into a rate of fuel consumption, and to predict secondary power requirements from the heart and lungs, and basal metabolism. The third level, strategic theory, uses predictions from the lower levels to investigate migration strategies, which are supposedly optimal in the ecological and evolutionary contexts. A number of questions require attention to bridge existing gaps in the lower levels of theory, especially (1) the direct measurement of mechanical power output (not oxygen consumption). (2) the measurement of two "biological constants", the isometric force exerted by one myosin filament, and the inverse power density of mitochondria, (3) the prediction of the mass and secondary power requirements of the heart and lungs, from the primary power requirement off the night muscles, and (4) the nature of basal metabolism, and the manner in which it combines with other demands for power in the active animal. A complete theory at the physical and physiological levels can be used to construct computer simulations of migratory night by particular birds. Such simulations can be used to approach the third (strategic) level of theory if values for input variables are obtained from field observations of real birds. The results can then be used to infer what the underlying strategy is, rather than postulating that the bird is selecting from a limited choice of possible strategies, derived analytically. The traditional emphasis on measurements of oxygen consumption, with little or no reference to the physics of the bird or the conditions of flight, does not help in building up a comprehensive body of theory, but this type of experiment could still be useful, to check the predictions of theory at the physical and physiological levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Marine sponge species are of significant interest to many scientific fields including marine ecology, conservation biology, genetics, host-microbe symbiosis and pharmacology. One of the most intriguing aspects of the sponge "holobiont" system is the unique physiology, interaction with microbes from the marine environment and the development of a complex commensal microbial community. However, intraspecific variability and temporal stability of sponge-associated bacterial symbionts remain relatively unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have characterized the bacterial symbiont community biodiversity of seven different individuals of the Caribbean reef sponge Axinella corrugata, from two different Florida reef locations during variable seasons using multiplex 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons. Over 265,512 high-quality 16 S rRNA sequences were generated and analyzed. Utilizing versatile bioinformatics methods and analytical software such as the QIIME and CloVR packages, we have identified 9,444 distinct bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Approximately 65,550 rRNA sequences (24%) could not be matched to bacteria at the class level, and may therefore represent novel taxa. Differentially abundant classes between seasonal Axinella communities included Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacter and Nitrospira. Comparisons with a proximal outgroup sponge species (Amphimedon compressa), and the growing sponge symbiont literature, indicate that this study has identified approximately 330 A. corrugata-specific symbiotic OTUs, many of which are related to the sulfur-oxidizing Ectothiorhodospiraceae. This family appeared exclusively within A. corrugata, comprising >34.5% of all sequenced amplicons. Other A. corrugata symbionts such as Deltaproteobacteria, Bdellovibrio, and Thiocystis among many others are described. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Slight shifts in several bacterial taxa were observed between communities sampled during spring and fall seasons. New 16 S rDNA sequences and concomitant identifications greatly expand the microbial community profile for this model reef sponge, and will likely be useful as a baseline for any future comparisons regarding sponge microbial community dynamics. },

abstract = {Eight adult female harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) of the White Sea–Barents Sea stock were tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders during the nursing period and followed from breeding in late February 1995 until moulting in late April 1995. Another ten adult harp seals of both sexes were tagged and followed from moult in early May 1996 until breeding in late February the following year. Between breeding and moult the seals were distributed along the coasts of Kola of Russia and eastern Finnmark of Norway, coinciding in time and space with the spawning capelin (Mallotus villosus). Between moulting and breeding they encircled the entire Barents Sea, mostly in open water, using the water column from 20 to 300 m, and in so doing by and large reflecting the annual migra- tions of the capelin. Capelin is therefore assumed to be the main source of prey for the White Sea–Barents Sea stock of harp seals, to be substituted, in part, by amphipods (e.g. Themisto libellula) in mid-summer and polar cod (Bore- ogadus saida) and herring (Clupea pallasii) in late autumn and winter. These data provide a baseline for the evaluation of the effects of future climatic change in the rich Barents Sea ecosystem.},

abstract = {Identifying environmental characteristics that define the ecological niche of a species is essential to understanding how changes in physical conditions might affect its distribution and other aspects of its ecology. The present study used satellite relay data loggers (SRDLs) to study habitat use by Northeast Atlantic hooded seals (N = 20; 9 adult females, 3 adult males, and 8 juveniles). Three different methods were used in combination to achieve maximum insight regarding key foraging areas for hooded seals in this region, which have decline by 85% in recent decades: 1) first passage time (FPT); 2) vertical transit rate and; 3) change in dive drift rate. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were applied to each method to determine whether specific habitat characteristics were associated with foraging. Separate models were run for the post-molting and the post-breeding seasons; sex and age classes were included in the GAMMs. All three methods highlighted a few common geographic areas as being important foraging zones; however, there were also some different areas identified by the different methods, which highlights the importance of using multiple indexes when analyzing tracking and diving data to study foraging behavior. Foraging occurred most commonly in relatively shallow areas with high Sea Surface Temperatures (SST), corresponding to continental shelf areas with Atlantic Water masses. All age and sex classes overlapped spatially to some extent, but the different age and sex groups showed differences in the bathymetry of their foraging areas as well as in their vertical use of the water column. When foraging, pups dove in the upper part of the water column in relatively deep areas. Adult females foraged relatively shallowly in deep water areas too, though in shallower areas than pups. Adult males foraged close to the bottom in shallower areas.},

abstract = {We investigated the spatial associations between minke Balaenoptera acutorostrata, fin B. physalus and humpback Megaptera novaeangliae whales and their prey in the Barents Sea in late summer of 2003 to 2007. During these years the abundance of their assumed primary prey, capelin Mallotus villotus, was low due to a stock collapse. The whales were therefore expected to associate with abundant herring Clupea harengus in the southern Barents Sea and krill (Euphausiacea) in the central and northern Barents Sea. The baleen whales predominantly occupied a narrow, northern area that had high densities of krill, amphipods Themisto spp., and polar cod Boreogadus saida along the northern range of the capelin distribution. A small proportion of the Barents Sea minke and fin whales occurred in the southern areas. Herring was therefore not an important prey species in the Barents Sea in this season. Ecosystem-scale associations, which were determined by spatial associations between species distributions averaged across years, indicated that krill was the predominant prey species. However, contrasting mesoscale associations with their prey in 50 km grid cells and a preference for shallow northern banks suggests that these whales have a diverse diet within a preferred habitat. Finally, positive density dependence and facilitation can be significant processes that influence whale distributions, as the 3 baleen whale species were positively associated at both ecosystem- and mesoscales.},

abstract = {Changes of agricultural practices have led to decline of semi-natural habitats sustained by traditional animal husbandry in many European regions. The abandonment of semi-natural pastures leads to increase of vascular plant biomass and subsequent decline of weak competitors such as bryophytes. Re-establishing traditional animal husbandry may potentially restore biodiversity but the success of such measures remains insufficiently known. In this study, we asked if re-establishing cattle grazing on previously abandoned grasslands will restore their bryophyte communities. The effect of cattle grazing on bryophyte communities of mesic semi-natural grasslands was studied in south-western Finland in a comparison of (i) continuously grazed pastures, (ii) previously abandoned pastures where grazing was re-established during 1990s, and (iii) abandoned pastures, where grazing had ceased during late 1960s to early 1980s. The average cover, species richness, species density and species diversity of bryophytes were significantly higher in the continuously grazed than in the abandoned grasslands. Ordination analyses revealed clear differences also in community structure between the management classes. Re-established grasslands were ecologically heterogeneous and situated in between the continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in all characteristics, indicating variable effect of the restoration measure. Seventeen bryophyte species were recognized as significant indicators of the three grassland classes, four of which could be used as indicators of valuable grassland habitats. Although there was variation in the consequences of re-introduction of grazing, the results give evidence of positive effect of grazing on regaining bryophyte diversity of abandoned grasslands.},

Using a multi-year dataset of satellite-tagged whales, as well as information on krill catch levels, we analyzed the spatial distribution of whales and fisheries effort within the small-scale management units defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Using a Bayesian movement model to partition whale movement into traveling and area-restricted search states, we found that both whale behavior and krill catch effort were spatially clustered, with distinct hotspots of the whale activity in the Gerlache and southern Branfield Straits. These areas align with increases in krill fishing effort, and present potential areas of current and future conflict. We recommend that the Antarctic West and Bransfield Strait West management units merit particular attention when setting fine-scale catch limits and, more broadly, consideration as critical areas for krill predator foraging.},

@article{Turchin1991,
abstract = {The relationship between movement and population dynamics in heterogeneous environments has been approached from two directions: theoretical analyses using diffusion models and empirical studies that often employ computer simulations. In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the "diffusion-approximation" procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat. My first goal in this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlak's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of "residence index." The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch. I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host-plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent. Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence-index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer-resource (e.g., predator-prey or herbivore-host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.},

abstract = {A serendipitous > 8-month time series of hydrographic properties was obtained from the vicinity of the South Orkney Islands, Southern Ocean, by tagging a southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonine) on Signy Island with a Conductivity-Temperature-Depth/Satellite-Relay Data Logger (CTD-SRDL) in March 2007. Such a time series (including data from the austral autumn and winter) would have been extremely difficult to obtain via other means, and it illustrates with unprecedented temporal resolution the seasonal progression of upper-ocean water mass properties and stratification at this location. Sea ice production values of around 0.15-0.4 m month(-1) for April to July were inferred from the progression of salinity, with significant levels still in September (around 0.2 m month(-1)). However, these values presume that advective processes have negligible effect on the salinity changes observed locally; this presumption is seen to be inappropriate in this case, and it is argued that the ice production rates inferred are better considered as "smeared averages" for the region of the northwestern Weddell Sea upstream from the South Orkneys. The impact of such advective effects is illustrated by contrasting the observed hydrographic series with the output of a one-dimensional model of the upper-ocean forced with local fluxes. It is found that the difference in magnitude between local (modelled) and regional (inferred) ice production is significant, with estimates differing by around a factor of two. A halo of markedly low sea ice concentration around the South Orkneys during the austral winter offers at least a partial explanation for this, since it enabled stronger atmosphere/ocean fluxes to persist and hence stronger ice production to prevail locally compared with the upstream region. The year of data collection was an El Nino year, and it is well-established that this phenomenon can impact strongly on the surface ocean and ice field in this sector of the Southern Ocean, thus the possibility of our time series being atypical cannot be ruled out. Longer-term collection of in situ ocean data from this locality would be desirable, to address issues relating to interannual variability and long-term change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The study of the organization of dives in bouts has provided insights into the foraging ecology of many species of diving animals. In otariids and seabirds, the alternation between dive bouts and periods at the surface has been proved to reflect the distinction between time spent foraging in patches and moving between them, allowing bouts to be interpreted as foraging units. Phocid seals, however, are known to be able to travel and rest while diving, making the interpretation of bouts less straightforward. We investigated the behavioural interpretation of dive bouts and surfacing periods in harbour seals, Phoca vitulina. We propose an approach in which the organization of bouts of dives at different temporal scales is compared with information on the seals' horizontal movements and dive characteristics. We found that prolonged surfacing periods could be generally interpreted as at-sea resting events. We also examined the occurrence of potential resting behaviour while diving and found that harbour seals perform low-activity dives, with different incidence between individuals. We conclude that bout organization in harbour seals mainly reflects the alternation of periods of activity and resting and that harbour seals spend a significant amount of time resting at sea. However, dive bouts cannot be considered as behavioural units, since both movement and some of the resting activity occur within them. This approach highlights the presence in this species of behaviours of similar function (i.e. resting), expressed in different forms (i.e. haul out, prolonged surfacing, low-activity diving), the cumulative patterns of which are well related to the daylight cycle.},

abstract = {Ringed seal (Pusa hispida) abundance in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, was estimated during the peak molting period via aerial, digital photographic surveys. A total of 9,145 images, covering 41.7%-100% of the total fast-ice cover (1,496 km2) of 18 different fjords and bays, were inspected for the presence of ringed seals. A total of 1,708 seals were counted, and when accounting for ice areas that were not covered by images, a total of 3,254 (95% CI: 3,071-3,449) ringed seals were estimated to be hauled out during the surveys. Extensive behavioral data from radio-tagged ringed seals (collected in a companion study) from one of the highest density fjords during the molting period were used to create a model that predicts the proportion of seals hauled out on any given date, time of day, and under various meteorological conditions. Applying this model to the count data from each fjord, we estimated that a total of 7,585 (95% CI: 6,332-9,085) ringed seals were present in the surveyed area during the peak molting period. Data on interannual variability in ringed seal abundance suggested higher numbers of seals in Van Keulenfjorden in 2002 compared to 2003, while other fjords with very stable ice cover showed no statistical differences. Poor ice conditions in general in 2002 probably resulted in seals from a wide area coming to Van Keulenfjorden (a large fjord with stable ice in 2002). The total estimated number of ringed seals present in the study area at the time of the survey must be regarded as a population index, or at least a minimum estimate for the area, because it does not account for individuals leaving and arriving, which might account for a considerable number of animals. The same situation is likely the case for many other studies reporting aerial census data for ringed seals. To achieve accurate estimates of population sizes from aerial surveys, more extensive knowledge of ringed seal behavior will be required. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

collapses of the forage fish capelin Mallotus villosus have been
observed. The white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris, a
flexible predator with a diverse diet in other marine systems, has been
associated with capelin in the Barents Sea. Yet, their distribution and
foraging ecology in this ecosystem remain largely unknown. Here we use
synoptically collected dolphin and prey spatial data to investigate the
dolphins' distribution and spatial associations with potential prey
species, including the spatial responses to a capelin stock collapse of
2003-2006 and recovery in 2007-2009. Since dolphin-prey associations may
be scale-dependent, analyses were conducted at two spatial scales: (1)
the habitat scale, by investigating spatial associations between species
distributions averaged across years, and (2) the mesoscale, by
investigating spatial associations within 50 x 50 km grid cells. At the
habitat scale, dolphins overlapped with different prey species in
different parts of their habitat. At the mesoscale, the dolphins were
associated with blue whiting in southern Atlantic waters, while no prey
associations were identified in the Polar Front area, where both capelin
and gadoids are abundant. The poor dolphin-prey associations in this
area could indicate dolphin distributions spatially constrained by
physiological limitations, habitat productivity, or niche partitioning.
No strong dolphin responses to capelin collapse and recovery were
observed, indicating sufficient availability of alternative prey during
the collapse.},

abstract = {Observations suggest that shrub abundance in the Arctic is increasing owing to climate warming. We investigated the ramifications of a tundra-to-shrubland transition on winter energy exchange. At five sites in Alaska we suspended a 50-m-long cable above the vegetation and from this measured how the vegetation interacted with the snow and affected albedo. The sites defined a gradient from nearly shrub-free tundra to a woodland with a continuous shrub canopy. Where the shrubs were small, thin-stemmed, and supple, they were bent and buried by snow. Where they were tall, thick-stemmed, and stiff, the shrub canopy remained exposed all winter. Where shrubs were buried, mid-winter albedo values were high (0.85), but where they were exposed, the values were 30% lower (0.60). At these latter sites, melting began several weeks earlier but proceeded more slowly. Consequently, all sites were free of snow about the same time. Using the measurements and a solar model, we estimate that a land surface transition from shrub-free tundra to shrubland could produce a 69 to 75% increase in absorbed solar radiation during the snow-cover period, depending on latitude. This is two thirds the increase associated with a tundra-to-forest transition. When combined with measurements showing that a tundra-to-shrub transition would also produce a net increase in summer heating, our results suggest a positive feedback mechanism associated with a warming-induced increase in shrubs. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to document that shrubs could alter the winter energy balance of tundra in such a substantial way.},

abstract = {The demand for renewable energy has led to construction of offshore wind farms with high-power turbines, and many more wind farms are being planned for the shallow waters of the world's marine habitats. The growth of offshore wind farms has raised concerns about their impact on the marine environment. Marine mammals use sound for foraging, orientation and communication and are therefore possibly susceptible to negative effects of man-made noise generated from constructing and operating large offshore wind turbines. This paper reviews the existing literature and assesses zones of impact from different noise-generating activities in conjunction with wind farms on 4 representative shallow-water species of marine mammals. Construction involves many types of activities that can generate high sound pressure levels, and pile-driving seems to be the noisiest of all. Both the literature and modeling show that pile-driving and other activities that generate intense impulses during construction are likely to disrupt the behavior of marine mammals at ranges of many kilometers, and that these activities have the potential to induce hearing impairment at close range. The reported noise levels from operating wind turbines are low, and are unlikely to impair hearing in marine mammals. The impact zones for marine mammals from operating wind turbines depend on the low-frequency hearing-abilities of the species in question, on sound-propagation conditions, and on the presence of other noise sources such as shipping. The noise impact on marine mammals is more severe during the construction of wind farms than during their operation. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2006.},

@article{Thums2011,
abstract = {Predators are thought to reduce travel speed and increase turning rate in areas where resources are relatively more abundant, a behavior termed "area-restricted search." However, evidence for this is rare, and few empirical data exist for large predators. Animals exhibiting foraging site fidelity could also be spatially aware of suitable feeding areas based on prior experience; changes in movement patterns might therefore arise from the anticipation of higher prey density. We tested the hypothesis that regions of area-restricted search were associated with a higher number of daily speed spikes (a proxy for potential prey encounter rate) and foraging success in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), a species exhibiting both area-restricted searches and high interannual foraging site fidelity. We used onshore morphological measurements and diving data from archival tags deployed during winter foraging trips. Foraging success was inferred from in situ changes in relative lipid content derived from measured changes in buoyancy, and first-passage time analysis was used to identify area-restricted search behavior. Seals exhibited relatively direct southerly movement on average, with intensive search behavior predominantly located at the distal end of tracks. The probability of being in search mode was positively related to changes in relative lipid content; thus, intensively searched areas were associated with the highest foraging success. However, there was high foraging success during the outward transit even though seals moved through quickly without slowing down and increasing turning rate to exploit these areas. In addition, the probability of being in search mode was negatively related to the number of daily speed spikes. These results suggest that movement patterns represent a response to prior expectation of the location of predictable and profitable resources. Shelf habitat was 4-9 times more profitable than the other habitats, emphasizing the importance of the East Antarctic shelf for this and other predators in the region. We have provided rare empirical data with which to investigate the relationship between predator foraging strategy and prey encounter/ foraging success, underlining the importance of inferring the timing and spatial arrangement of successful food acquisition for interpreting foraging strategies correctly. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Deriving the time frame within which each factor has a causal influence is important for predicting population trajectories. This paper presents a statistical methodology for establishing (i) the strength of causal coupling between population dynamics and environmental (biotic and abiotic) factors, and (ii) the time scales over which causal covariates have significant influence on the population dynamics. The methodology is based on combining a multivariate autoregressive model fit to data (to determine causal direction) with a quantification of the RPC of covariates in frequency domain (to quantify the strength of connection). The methodology is applied to test the existence of causal coupling between the capelin biomass and a selected number of covariates identified in the literature.},

abstract = {The Barents Sea ecosystem has undergone substantial ecological fluctuations over the past 40 yr, including large variations in the abundance of capelin Mallotus villosus, herring Clupea harrengus, krill Thysanoessa sp. and Meganyctiphanes norvegica, polar cod Boreo gadus saida, and Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. There is evidence to suggest that harp seals Pagophilus groenlandicus have responded to these changes. The current study analysed the relationships between harp seal body condition, environmental variables and the biomass of major harp seal prey. Harp seal body condition was estimated from samples taken in the southeastern Barents Sea during spring from 1992 to 2011. Body condition of juveniles and adults varied between years, improving from 1992 until 2001 and later deteriorating, with weakest condition in 2011. We inves- tigated covariates that might explain such interannual variation. Significant relationships were found between harp seal blubber thickness and prey abundances. High abundances of capelin, polar cod and Atlantic cod had a negative impact on condition, whereas high abundance of krill had a positive impact. Environmental covariates did not improve the models, probably because these were strongly correlated with prey abundance. We also found a correlation between pup production and blubber thickness, indicating that observed declines in pup production may be associated with decreased body condition of the seals. We further show that competitive inter - actions in the food web (e.g. competition between harp seals and some of their prey for shared resources, such as krill) may result in unexpected negative predator–prey relationships. This has implications for predator breeding success and population dynamics.},

In this context, it is important to understand the dynamics of the anchovy distribution to preserve it as well as to exploit its economic capacities. Using the data collected by the “Instituto del Mar del Per{\'{u}}” ({IMARPE}) during a scientific survey in 2005, we present a statistical analysis that has as main goals: (i) to adapt to the characteristics of the sampled data, such as spatial dependence, high proportions of zeros and big size of samples; (ii) to provide important insights on the dynamics of the anchovy population; and (iii) to propose a model for estimation and prediction of anchovy biomass in the {NHCS} offshore from Per{\'{u}}. These data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using the integrated nested Laplace approximation ({INLA}) method. Further, to select the best model and to study the predictive power of each model, we performed model comparisons and predictive checks, respectively. Finally, we carried out a Bayesian spatial influence diagnostic for the preferred model.},

abstract = {The recent increase in data accuracy from high resolution accelerometers offers substantial potential for improved understanding and prediction of animal movements. However, current approaches used for analysing these multivariable datasets typically require existing knowledge of the behaviors of the animals to inform the behavioral classification process. These methods are thus not wellsuited for the many cases where limited knowledge of the different behaviors performed exist. Here, we introduce the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm. To illustrate the method's capability we analyse data collected using a combination of GPS and Accelerometers on two seabird species: razorbills (Alca torda) and common guillemots (Uria aalge). We applied the unsupervised learning algorithm Expectation Maximization to characterize latent behavioral states both above and below water at both individual and group level. The application of this flexible approach yielded significant new insights into the foraging strategies of the two study species, both above and below the surface of the water. In addition to general behavioral modes such as flying, floating, as well as descending and ascending phases within the water column, this approach allowed an exploration of previously unstudied and important behaviors such as searching and prey chasing/capture events. We propose that this unsupervised learning approach provides an ideal tool for the systematic analysis of such complex multivariable movement data that are increasingly being obtained with accelerometer tags across species. In particular, we recommend its application in cases where we have limited current knowledge of the behaviors performed and existing supervised learning approaches may have limited utility.},

Southern right whales have been extensively hunted over the last 300 years and although numbers have recovered from near extinction in the early 20(th) century, current populations are fragmented and are estimated at only a small fraction of pre-hunting total. Recent extreme right whale calf mortality events at Pen{\'{i}}nsula Vald{\'{e}}s, which constitutes the largest single population, have raised fresh concern for the future of the species. The WorldView2 satellite has a maximum 50 cm resolution and a water penetrating coastal band in the far-blue part of the spectrum that allows it to see deeper into the water column. Using an image covering 113 km(2), we identified 55 probable whales and 23 other features that are possibly whales, with a further 13 objects that are only detected by the coastal band. Comparison of a number of classification techniques, to automatically detect whale-like objects, showed that a simple thresholding technique of the panchromatic and coastal band delivered the best results. This is the first successful study using satellite imagery to count whales; a pragmatic, transferable method using this rapidly advancing technology that has major implications for future surveys of cetacean populations.},

abstract = {Recent research using repeat photography, long-term ecological monitoring and dendrochronology has documented shrub expansion in arctic, high-latitude and alpine tundra ecosystems. Here, we (1) synthesize these findings, (2) present a conceptual framework that identifies mechanisms and constraints on shrub increase, (3) explore causes, feedbacks and implications of the increased shrub cover in tundra ecosystems, and (4) address potential lines of investigation for future research. Satellite observations from around the circumpolar Arctic, showing increased productivity, measured as changes in 'greenness', have coincided with a general rise in high-latitude air temperatures and have been partly attributed to increases in shrub cover. Studies indicate that warming temperatures, changes in snow cover, altered disturbance regimes as a result of permafrost thaw, tundra fires, and anthropogenic activities or changes in herbivory intensity are all contributing to observed changes in shrub abundance. A large-scale increase in shrub cover will change the structure of tundra ecosystems and alter energy fluxes, regional climate, soil-atmosphere exchange of water, carbon and nutrients, and ecological interactions between species. In order to project future rates of shrub expansion and understand the feedbacks to ecosystem and climate processes, future research should investigate the species or trait-specific responses of shrubs to climate change including: (1) the temperature sensitivity of shrub growth, (2) factors controlling the recruitment of new individuals, and (3) the relative influence of the positive and negative feedbacks involved in shrub expansion.},

abstract = {The submarine canyon off Kaikōura (New Zealand) is an extremely productive deep-sea habitat, and an important foraging ground for male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). We used high-resolution archival tags to study the diving behaviour of sperm whales, and used the echoes from their echolocation sounds to estimate their distance from the seafloor. Diving depths and distance above the seafloor were obtained for 28 dives from six individuals. Whales foraged at depths between 284 and 1433 m, targeting mesopelagic and demersal prey layers. The majority of foraging buzzes occurred within one of three vertical strata: within 50 m of the seafloor, mid-water at depths of 700–900 m, and mid-water at depths of 400–600 m. Sperm whales sampled during this study performed more demersal foraging than that reported in any previous studies – including at Kaikōura in further inshore waters. This suggests that the extreme benthic productivity of the Kaikōura Canyon is reflected in the trophic preferences of these massive top predators. We found some evidence for circadian patterns in the foraging behaviour of sperm whales, which might be related to vertical movements of their prey following the deep scattering layer. We explored the ecological implications of the whales' foraging preferences on their habitat use, highlighting the need for further research on how submarine canyons facilitate top predator hotspots.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that plant communities in the Low Arctic are responding to recent increases in air temperature. Changes to vegetation, particularly shifts in the abundance of upright shrubs, can influence surface energy balance (albedo), sensible and latent heat flux (evapotranspiration), snow conditions, and the ground thermal regime. Understanding fine-scale variability in vegetation across the shrub tundra ecotone is therefore essential as a monitoring baseline. In this article, we use object-based classifications of airphotos to examine changes in vegetation characteristics (cover and patch size) across a latitudinal gradient in the Mackenzie Delta uplands. This area is frequently mapped as homogenous vegetation, but it exhibits fine-scale variability in cover and patch size. Our results show that the total area and size of individual patches of shrub tundra decrease with increasing latitude. The gradual nature of this transition and its correlation with latitudinal variation in temperature suggests that the position of the shrub ecotone will be sensitive to continued warming. The impacts of vegetation structure on ecological processes make improved understanding of this heterogeneity critical to biophysical models of Low Arctic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The ongoing revolution in high-throughput sequencing continues to democratize the ability of small groups of investigators to map the microbial component of the biosphere. In particular, the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software tools allows data acquisition and analysis on an unprecedented scale. Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known "mock communities" at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. },

Although valid, the numerical maximization procedure used by Lele and Keim ( 2006) is unstable because of the inherent roughness of the Monte Carlo likelihood function. We used a combination of the methods of partial likelihood and data cloning to obtain maximum likelihood estimators of the RSPF in a numerically stable fashion. We demonstrated the methodology using simulated data sets generated under the log-log RSPF model and a reanalysis of telemetry data presented in Lele and Keim ( 2006) using the logistic RSPF model. The new method for estimation of RSPF can be used to understand differential selection of resources by animals, an essential component of studies in conservation biology, wildlife management, and applied ecology.

abstract = {1. The study of habitat selection and habitat use are crucial for understanding the biological requirements of animals and the strategies they use to fulfil their needs. A variety of statistical techniques are available to quantify habitat selection, most of them based on the comparison of habitat attributes in sites used by the animals and in unused, but available, sites. Because of the difficulties in defining what is available from an animal's perspective for many species, statistical approaches such as first-passage time (FPT) analysis have been developed, which explore habitat-use intensities through the areas used by animals. 2. In this study, we expand on that approach by using FPT-derived data within the framework of mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models (CPH models) to quantify habitat selection. By modelling FPTs, CPH models evaluate which habitat attributes best explain the 'risk' or 'hazard' of the animal leaving an area of a given radius. For quantitative interpretations, the coefficients of the CPH model can be used to calculate hazard ratios that estimate relative habitat preferences: the lower the hazard ratio (i.e. the lower the risk of leaving), the higher the preference. Accounting for individual variability in habitat use by means of a random-effect term added to CPH models provides inferences that more appropriately reflect the typical hierarchical structure of telemetric data on animal space use. 3. Synthesis and applications. In addition to providing inferences about habitat selection based on the estimated parameters, survival functions of fixed-effects CPH models can be used to construct spatial predictions, for instance maps of population-level space use. Such predictions can be particularly useful for applied purposes, for example as a basis for species conservation plans and reserve selection. The method is illustrated using two data sets from marine mammal species: ringed seals Phoca hispida and white whales Delphinapterus leucas, but it is broadly applicable to habitat selection and prediction studies of other highly mobile animals in marine or terrestrial systems.},

abstract = {To ensure efficient and sustainable purse-seine fisheries, the catch process must be monitored to better understand the reactions of fish to the gear. In this study, we monitored the behaviours of herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) schools during purse-seine capture using a multibeam imaging sonar (Simrad MS70, 75-112 kHz) mounted on a research vessel. The fish behaviours differed between species and purse-seine sets. For both species, the acoustic volume backscattering coefficient increased as 0-80% of the seine was hauled aboard, indicating a corresponding increase in fish spatial density. This increase was significantly greater for herring than mackerel. As 0-40% of the seine was hauled aboard the fishing vessel, schools changed their spatial distribution and volume independent of seine hauling, while for some schools, depth and height decreased. The acoustic volume backscattering strength was up to 25 dB higher in the centre of the school than in the edges. The average lateral target strength was estimated for individual fish in the captured herring schools, and the effect of incident angle on the backscattering strength is considered.},

abstract = {We present a framework for fitting multiple random walks to animal movement paths consisting of ordered sets of step lengths and turning angles. Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east-central Ontario, Canada, suggests it biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an "encamped" state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an "exploratory" state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.},

abstract = {Monitored seabird populations—useful sentinels of marine ecosystem health—have been declining worldwide at a rapid pace. Yet, lack of reliable long-term monitoring data constrains assessment of the conservation status of many seabird populations. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to increase survey efficiency and count precision of seabird populations, especially where time constraints or inaccessible terrain, such as sea stacks, limit meaningful ground-based surveys. Furthermore, tremendous potential exists to combine fine-scale spatially integrated habitat mapping obtained from UAV images with occupancy to unravel how abiotic factors such as topography affect animal populations. In late December 2018, we used an UAV to create a georeferenced orthomosaic image and digital elevation model (DEM) from which we determined the size of the Antarctic shag (Leucocarbo bransfieldensis) breeding colony at Harmony Point, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands. Our population estimate of 69 breeding pairs is approximately double that reported for the early 2000s and the highest count since the late 1980s. Most nests were located 10 to 20 m above sea level, on relatively shallow gradients that predominantly faced southeast. While it is difficult to compare historical ground-based counts with the UAV-derived estimates presented here, our new data provide robust baseline information for future monitoring of the colony population size using comparable survey methods. Our basic mapping of the topography of the breeding colony also highlights how UAV-derived habitat information can facilitate our understanding of the influence of landscape structure on animal population dynamics.},

abstract = {Many pinnipeds frequently rest on land or ice, but some species remain in open waters for weeks or months, raising the question of how they rest. A unique type of dive, called drift dives, has been reported for several pinnipeds with suggested functions of rest, food processing and predator avoidance. Prolonged surfacing periods have also been observed in captive seals and are thought to aid food processing. However, information from other species in a different environment would be required to better understand the nature and function of this behavior. In this study, we attached multi-sensor tags to Baikal seals Pusa sibirica, a rare, freshwater species that has no aquatic predators and few resting grounds during the ice-free season. The seals exhibited repeated drift dives (mean depth, 116 m; duration, 10.1 min) in the daytime and prolonged periods at the surface (mean duration, 1.3 h) mainly around dawn. Drift dives and prolonged surfacing periods were temporally associated and observed between a series of foraging dives, suggesting a similar function, i.e. a combination of resting and food processing. The maximum durations of both drift and foraging dives were 15.4 min, close to the aerobic dive limit of this species; therefore, metabolic rates might not be significantly depressed during drift dives, further supporting the function of food processing rather than purely resting. Our results also show that drift diving can occur in a predator-free environment, and thus predator avoidance is not a general explanation of drift dives in pinnipeds.},

In 10 sampling areas, distribution, site characteristics, and condition (damage degree, growth forms) of the new pines (pines that have become established since the mid 20th century) were checked in a zone 50 m to the left and right of our field routes. The field routes extended from the scattered birch forest to the treeless alpine zone and mountaintops and covered a total area of more than 4 km(2). In total, 213 new pines were found. Tree height was measured and age estimated by counting the whorls. The degree of damage was estimated and then attributed to four damage classes. Pine establishment was most successful during the 1970s and up until the end of the last century. Pines younger than 10 years are rare (< 3%) in the study areas, with one exception (about 8%). Pine recruitment is comparatively intense in close proximity to old pines in the birch forest while it is sporadic within the scattered birch stands at higher elevations and in the alpine tundra. More than 80% of the new pines show disturbed growth forms due to frequent winter injury, reindeer, and moose. About 66% exhibit severe damage, and 15% have already died. On windswept terrain, microsite facilitation is essential for pine establishment. Lack of local seed sources and severe site conditions at high elevations have probably delayed pine altitudinal advance. New pine generations may become effective seed sources speeding up pine advance beyond the present seed trees. In view of the high proportions of severely damaged and dead new pines, we do not expect that climatic warming will bring about a rapid advance of the pine tree limit.},

abstract = {Surveys of Euphausia superba often target localised shelves and ice edges where their growth rates and predation losses are atypically high. Emphasis on these areas has led to the current view that krill require high food concentrations, with a distribution often linked to shelves. For a wider, circumpolar perspective, we compiled all available net-based density data on postlarvae from 8137 mainly summer stations from 1926 to 2004. Unlike Antarctic zooplankton, the distribution of E. superba is highly uneven, with 70 % of the total stock concentrated between longitudes 0° and 90° W. Within this Atlantic sector, krill are abundant over both continental shelf and ocean. At the Antarctic Peninsula they are found mainly over the inner shelf, whereas in the Indian-Pacific sectors krill prevail in the ocean within 200 to 300 km of the shelf break. Overall, 87% of the total stock lives over deep oceanic water (>2000 m), and krill occupy regions with moderate food concentrations (0.5 to 1.0 mg chl am-3). Advection models suggest some northwards loss from these regions and into the low chlorophyll belts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). We found possible evidence for a compensating southwards migration, with an increasing proportion of krill found south of the ACC as the season progresses. The retention of krill in moderately productive oceanic habitats is a key factor in their high total production. While growth rates are lower than over shelves, the ocean provides a refuge from shelf-based predators. The unusual circumpolar distribution of krill thus reflects a balance between advection, migration, top-down and bottom-up processes. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

They are also the species most often stranded in association with Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar use, a relationship that remains poorly understood. We used satellite-linked tags to record the diving behavior and locations of eight Ziphius off the Southern California coast for periods up to three months. The effort resulted in 3732 hr of dive data with associated regional movements – the first dataset of its kind for any beaked whale – and included dives to 2992 m depth and lasting 137.5 min, both new mammalian dive records. Deep dives had a group mean depth of 1401 m (s.d.=137.8, n=1142) and duration of 67.4 min (s.d.=6.9). The group mean time between deep dives was 102.3 min (s.d.=30.8, n=783). While the previously described stereotypic pattern of deep and shallow dives was apparent, there was considerable inter- and intra-individual variability in most parameters. There was significant diel behavioral variation, including increased time near the surface and decreased shallow diving at night. However, maximum depth and the proportion of time spent on deep dives (presumed foraging), varied little from day to night. Surprisingly, tagged whales were present within an MFA sonar training range for 38% of days locations were received, and though comprehensive records of sonar use during tag deployments were not available, we discuss the effects frequent acoustic disturbance may have had on the observed behaviors. These data better characterize the true behavioral range of this species, and suggest caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about behavior using short-term datasets.},

abstract = {We review recent advances in attosecond science; particular attention is devoted to the generation, temporal characterization and applications of isolated attosecond pulses. After a brief overview of the physical mechanisms at the basis of attosecond pulse generation, the experimental methods used for the production of isolated sub-femtosecond pulses are discussed, with particular emphasis on the polarization gating method, which is based on the use of driving pulses with a time-dependent polarization state. The recent emergence of attosecond metrology is described and various techniques for temporal characterization of extreme ultraviolet pulses in the sub-femtosecond regime are analyzed. The streak-camera approach turned out to be an extremely powerful method: all applications of isolated attosecond pulses reported so far are essentially based on such experimental approach. We furthermore discuss recently proposed applications of isolated attosecond pulses in various research fields. Particularly interesting will be the application of attosecond pulses to the investigation of multielectron systems. The collective electronic motion in complex systems and the electron correlation mechanisms represent fundamental problems in atomic and molecular physics, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view: the application of attosecond pulses promises to offer a formidable tool for the experimental investigation of such fundamental physical processes. Moreover the possibility to directly measure and control the ultrafast charge migration process in complex molecules, which is at the basis of fundamental processes in nature, can open the way to the emergence of attochemistry, with important consequences both for fundamental research and technology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to investigate whether environmental temperature affects respiratory turbinate structure in phocids, we used micro-computed tomography to compare maxilloturbinate bone morphology in polar seals, grey seals and monk seals. The maxilloturbinates of polar seals have much higher surface areas than those of monk seals, the result of the polar seals having more densely packed, complex turbinates within larger nasal cavities. Grey seals were intermediate; a juvenile of this species proved to have more densely packed maxilloturbinates with shorter branch lengths than a conspecific adult. Fractal dimension in the densest part of the maxilloturbinate mass was very close to 2 in all seals, indicating that these convoluted bones evenly fill the available space. The much more elaborate maxilloturbinate systems in polar seals, compared with monk seals, are consistent with a greater need to limit respiratory heat loss.},

abstract = {Using a newly developed data logger to measure acceleration, we demonstrate that free-ranging king and Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins only beat their flippers substantially during the first part of descent or when they were presumed to be chasing prey at the bottom of dives. Flipper beating stopped during the latter part of ascent: at 29±9% (mean ± S.D.) of dive depth (mean dive depth=136.8±145.1 m, N=425 dives) in king penguins, and at 52±20 % of dive depth (mean dive depth=72.9±70.5 m, N=664 dives) in Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins. Propulsive swim speeds of both species were approximately 2ms-1 during dives; however, a marked increase in speed, up to approximately 2.9 ms-1, sometimes occurred in king penguins during the passive ascending periods. During the prolonged ascending, oblique ascent angle and slowdown near the surface may represent one way to avoid the potential risk of decompression sickness. Biomechanical calculations for data from free-ranging king and Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins indicate that the air volume of the birds (respiratory system and plumage) can provide enough buoyancy for the passive ascent. When comparing the passive ascents for shallow and deep dives, there is a positive correlation between air volume and the depth of the dive. This suggests that penguins regulate their air volume to optimize the costs and benefits of buoyancy.},

abstract = {The repartition of tracers in the ocean's upper layer on the scale of a few tens of kilometres is largely determined by the horizontal transport induced by surface currents. Here we consider surface currents detected from satellite altimetry (Jason and Envisat missions) and we study how surface waters may be trapped by mesoscale eddies through a semi-Lagrangian diagnostic which combines the Lyapunov approach with Eulerian techniques. Such a diagnostic identifies the regions of the ocean's upper layer with different retention times that appear to influence the behaviour of a tagged marine predator (an elephant seal) along a foraging trip. The comparison between predator trajectory and eddy retention time suggests that water trapping by mesoscale eddies, derived from satellite altimetry, may be an important factor for monitoring hotspots of trophic interactions in the open ocean.This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to ‘Lyapunov analysis: from dynamical systems theory to applications'.},

abstract = {Balaenid whales perform long breath-hold foraging dives despite a high drag from their ram filtration of zooplankton. To maximize the volume of prey acquired in a dive with limited oxygen supplies, balaenids must either filter feed only occasionally when prey density is particularly high, or they must swim at slow speeds while filtering to reduce drag and oxygen consumption. Using digital tags with three-axis accelerometers, we studied bowhead whales feeding off West Greenland and present here, to our knowledge, the first detailed data on the kinematics and swimming behaviour of a balaenid whale filter feeding at depth. Bowhead whales employ a continuous fluking gait throughout the bottom phase of foraging dives, moving at very slow speeds (less than 1 m s(-1)), allowing them to filter feed continuously at depth. Despite the slow speeds, the large mouth aperture provides a water filtration rate of approximately 3 m(3) s(-1), amounting to some 2000 tonnes of water and prey filtered per dive. We conclude that a food niche of dense, slow-moving zooplankton prey has led balaenids to evolve locomotor and filtering systems adapted to work against a high drag at swimming speeds of less than 0.07 body length s(-1) using a continuous fluking gait very different from that of nekton-feeding, aquatic predators.},

abstract = {The treeline ecotone divides forest from open alpine or arctic vegetation states. Treelines are generally perceived to be temperature limited. The role of herbivores in limiting the treeline is more controversial, as experimental evidence from relevant large scales is lacking. Here we quantify the impact of different experimentally controlled herbivore densities on the recruitment and survival of birch Betula pubescens tortuosa along an altitudinal gradient in the mountains of southern Norway. After eight years of summer grazing in large-scale enclosures at densities of 0, 25, and 80 sheep/km(2), birch recruited within the whole altitudinal range of ungrazed enclosures, but recruitment was rarer in enclosures with low-density sheep and was largely limited to within the treeline in enclosures with high-density sheep. In contrast, the distribution of saplings (birch older than the experiment) did not differ between grazing treatments, suggesting that grazing sheep primarily limit the establishment of new tree recruits rather than decrease the survival of existing individuals. This study provides direct experimental evidence that herbivores can limit the treeline below its potential at the landscape scale and even at low herbivore densities in this climatic zone. Land use changes should thus be considered in addition to climatic changes as potential drivers of ecotone shifts.},

abstract = {Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage fishery catches for fish popula- tions worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a sub- stantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high- or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efficiently than conventional “design-based” or stratified estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknownbecause geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species.Wedevelop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields.Weapply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous “strati- fied” index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the strati- fied model generates a relative index with 60% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20% lower estimation errors than a stratified model.Wetherefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.},

Our results showed that the birth rate of grey seals was significantly related to herring (Clupea harengus membras) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) quality (weight) which, in turn were influenced by sprat and cod (Gadus morhua) abundance, as well as zooplankton biomass and plankter size. This suggests strong trophic coupling over three trophic levels. We thus conclude that the birth rate of grey seals can be used as an indicator of the status of the Baltic food web.

Estimates of the annual seal pup production are critical factors in the abundance estimation needed for management of the species. These estimates are usually based on counts from aerial photographic surveys. However, only a minor part of the whelping region can be photographed, due to its large extent. To estimate the total seal pup production, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach motivated by viewing the seal pup appearances as a realization of a log-Gaussian Cox process using covariate information from satellite imagery as a proxy for ice thickness. For inference, we utilize the spatial partial differential equation (SPDE) module of the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework. In a case study using survey data from 2012, we compare our results with existing methodology in a comprehensive cross-validation study. The results of the cross validation study indicate that our method improves local estimation performance, and that the increased prediction uncertainty of our method is required to obtain calibrated count predictions. This suggests that the sampling density of the survey design may not be sufficient to obtain reliable estimates of the seal pup production.},

abstract = {Baleen whales are an important group of predators on Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean. During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill, International Whaling Commission observers carried out a visual line transect survey to estimate the number of baleen whales occurring in the survey area. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate krill consumption by baleen whales and in combination with estimates of whale abundance estimates of krill consumption are generated for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. This survey estimates that the present populations of whales feeding in this region are likely to consume approximately 1.6 million tonnes, but possibly up to as much as 2.7 million tonnes of krill within the summer season. Although this only represents 4-6% of the estimated krill biomass in the region (and probably less than this percentage of the total annual krill production), the depleted numbers of baleen whales resulting from past or current whaling activities should be taken into account when setting quotas for the commercial exploitation of krill if there is to be a recovery to pre-exploitation biomass levels of baleen whales.},

abstract = {In hierarchical patch systems, small-scale patches of high density are nested within large-scale patches of low density. The organization of multiple-scale hierarchical systems makes non-random strategies for dispersal and movement particularly important. Here, we apply a new method based on first-passage time on the pathway of a foraging seabird, the Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica), to quantify its foraging pattern and the spatial dynamics of its foraging areas. Our results suggest that Antarctic petrels used a nested search strategy to track a highly dynamic hierarchical patch system where small-scale patches were congregated within patches at larger scales. The birds searched for large-scale patches by traveling fast and over long distances. Once within a large-scale patch, the birds concentrated their search to find smaller scale patches. By comparing the pathway of different birds we were able to quantify the spatial scale and turnover of their foraging areas. On the largest scale we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 400 km. Nested within these areas we found foraging areas with a characteristic scale of about 100 km. The large-scale areas disappeared or moved within a time frame of weeks while the nested small-scale areas disappeared or moved within days. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is the dominant food item of Antarctic petrels and we suggest that our findings reflect the spatial dynamics of krill in the area.},

abstract = {Weddell Sea hydrography and circulation is driven by influx of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) at its eastern margin. Entrainment and upwelling of this high-nutrient, oxygen-depleted water mass within the Weddell Gyre also supports the mesopelagic ecosystem within the gyre and the rich benthic community along the Antarctic shelf. We used Conductivity-Temperature-Depth Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs) to examine the importance of hydrographic variability, ice cover and season on the movements and diving behavior of southern elephant seals in the eastern Weddell Sea region during their overwinter feeding trips from Bouvetoya. We developed a model describing diving depth as a function of local time of day to account for diel variation in diving behavior. Seals feeding in pelagic ice-free waters during the summer months displayed clear diel variation, with daytime dives reaching 500-1500 m and night-time targeting of the subsurface temperature and salinity maxima characteristic of CDW around 150-300 meters. This pattern was especially clear in the Weddell Cold and Warm Regimes within the gyre, occurred in the ACC, but was absent at the Dronning Maud Land shelf region where seals fed benthically. Diel variation was almost absent in pelagic feeding areas covered by winter sea ice, where seals targeted deep layers around 500-700 meters. Thus, elephant seals appear to switch between feeding strategies when moving between oceanic regimes or in response to seasonal environmental conditions. While they are on the shelf, they exploit the locally-rich benthic ecosystem, while diel patterns in pelagic waters in summer are probably a response to strong vertical migration patterns within the copepod-based pelagic food web. Behavioral flexibility that permits such switching between different feeding strategies may have important consequences regarding the potential for southern elephant seals to adapt to variability or systematic changes in their environment resulting from climate change.},

abstract = {Many pinniped species perform a specific dive type, referred to as a 'drift dive', where they drift passively through the water column. This dive type has been suggested to function as a resting/sleeping or food processing dive, and can be used as an indication of feeding success by calculating the daily change in vertical drift rates over time, which reflects the relative fluctuations in buoyancy of the animal as the proportion of lipids in the body change. Northwest Atlantic hooded seals perform drift dives at regular intervals throughout their annual migration across the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. We found that the daily change in drift rate varied with geographic location and the time of year and that this differed between sexes. Positive changes in buoyancy (reflecting increased lipid stores) were evident throughout their migration range and although overlapping somewhat, they were not statistically associated with high use areas as indicated by First Passage Time (FPT). Differences in the seasonal fluctuations of buoyancy between males and females suggest that they experience a difference in patterns of energy gain and loss during winter and spring, associated with breeding. The fluctuations in buoyancy around the moulting period were similar between sexes.},

abstract = {Knowledge of abundance and survival of humpback whales, white-beaked dolphins and minke whales are essential to manage and conserve these species in Icelandic coastal shelf waters. Our main goal was to test the feasibility of employing inexpensive research methods (data collected by trained-scientist volunteers onboard opportunistic vessels) to assess abundance and apparent survival. No previous studies in Iceland have investigated these two demographic parameters in these three cetacean species using open capture-recapture models accounting for imperfect and possibly heterogeneous detection. A transient effect was accounted for whenever required to estimate the population of resident individuals. Identification photographs were collected by scientist-trained volunteers for 7 years (2006–2013) from onboard commercial whale-watching vessels in the coastal waters of Faxafl{\'{o}}i (southwest coast, $\sim$ 4400 km2) and Skj{\'{a}}lfandi (northeast coast, $\sim$ 1100 km2), Iceland. We estimated an average abundance of 83 humpback whales (Mn; 95% confidence interval: 54–130) in Skj{\'{a}}lfandi; 238 white-beaked dolphins (La; [163–321]) in Faxafl{\'{o}}i; and 67 minke whales (Ba; [53–82]) in Faxafl{\'{o}}i and 24 (14–31) in Skj{\'{a}}lfandi. We also found that apparent survival was constant for all three species (Mn: 0.52 [0.41–0.63], La: 0.79 [0.64–0.88], Ba-Faxafl{\'{o}}i: 0.80 [0.67–0.88], Ba-Skj{\'{a}}lfandi: 0.96 [0.60–0.99]). Our results showed inter-annual variation in abundance estimates which were small for all species, and the presence of transience for minke whales. A significant increase in abundance during the study period was solely found in minke whale data from Skj{\'{a}}lfandi. Humpback whales and white-beaked dolphins showed lower apparent survival rates compared to similar baleen whale and dolphin populations. Our results show data collected by trained-scientist volunteers can produce viable estimates of abundance and survival although bias in the methods we employed exist and need to be addressed. With the continued increase in anthropogenic pressures on our three target populations in Iceland our results can be used by relevant stakeholders to develop appropriate conservation strategies in the region.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the resonance strategies of Sami reindeer herders in four reindeer-herding cooperatives in northernmost Finland in climatically extreme years, specifically those occurring during the period 1970-2007. "Resonance" is an instinctive and indwelling reaction of a herder to a specific change (in contrast to coping, which is a more general response). The study is based on interviews with herders, field experiences, reindeer population statistics, and weather data. Before the 1960s, herders were able to deal with changing weather conditions by using intensive herding techniques and semi-tame reindeer. After the 1960s, reindeer became wilder because of the use of snowmobiles and more extensive herding techniques. The herders of the fell and forest cooperatives did not have sufficient means to prevent the serious reindeer losses in 1972-74, which resulted from two years of hard snow and ice cover, hot summers, and the free ranging of loose herds. In each of the four cooperatives studied, most of the old siida herds were combined, and one solution to handling large, loose herds was to build fences between cooperatives. Since the 1990s, all four cooperatives have used diverse herding and pasture rotation strategies to cope with the critical winter months. The herding techniques and the human-reindeer relationship in the fell cooperatives have differed from those in the forest cooperatives mainly because of differences in pasture types, topography, and microclimate. The contrast can be seen particularly in snow and ice conditions, as open fell regions have a thin and compact snow cover, whereas forest regions typically have deep, soft snow. This research shows that the resonance strategies of Sami reindeer herders are both heterogeneous and dynamic: herders change them constantly, drawing on both old and new techniques to deal with the variable weather.},

abstract = {Buoyancy is one of the primary external forces acting on air-breathing divers and it can affect their swimming energetics. Because the body composition of marine mammals (i.e. the relative amounts of lower-density lipid and higher-density lean tissue) varies individually and seasonally, their buoyancy also fluctuates widely, and individuals would be expected to adjust their stroke patterns during dives accordingly. To test this prediction, we attached acceleration data loggers to four free-ranging Baikal seals Phoca sibirica in Lake Baikal and monitored flipper stroking activity as well as swimming speed, depth and inclination of the body axis (pitch). In addition to the logger, one seal (Individual 4) was equipped with a lead weight that was jettisoned after a predetermined time period so that we had a set of observations on the same individual with different body densities. These four data sets revealed the general diving patterns of Baikal seals and also provided direct insights into the influence of buoyancy on these patterns. Seals repeatedly performed dives of a mean duration of 7.0 min (max. 15.4 min), interrupted by a mean surface duration of 1.2 min. Dive depths were 66 m on average, but varied substantially, with a maximum depth of 324 m. The seals showed different stroke patterns among individuals; some seals stroked at lower rates during descent than ascent, while the others had higher stroke rates during descent than ascent. When the lead weight was detached from Individual 4, the seal increased its stroke rate in descent by shifting swimming mode from prolonged glides to more stroke-and-glide swimming, and decreased its stroke rate in ascent by shifting from continuous stroking to stroke-and-glide swimming. We conclude that seals adopt different stroke patterns according to their individual buoyancies. We also demonstrate that the terminal speed reached by Individual 4 during prolonged glide in descent depended on its total buoyancy and pitch, with higher speeds reached in the weighted condition and at steeper pitch. A simple physical model allowed us to estimate the body density of the seal from the speed and pitch (1,027-1,046 kg m(-3), roughly corresponding to 32-41% lipid content, for the weighted condition; 1,014-1,022 kg m(-3), 43-47% lipid content, for the unweighted condition).},

abstract = {The increasing need for continuous monitoring of the world oceans has stimulated the development of a range of autonomous sampling platforms. One novel addition to these approaches is a small, relatively inexpensive data-relaying device that can be deployed on marine mammals to provide vertical oceanographic profiles throughout the upper 2000 m of the water column. When an animal dives, the CTD-Satellite Relay Data Logger (CTD-SRDL) records vertical profiles of temperature, conductivity and pressure. Data are compressed once the animal returns to the surface where it is located by, and relays data to, the Argos satellite system. The technical challenges met in the design of the CTD-SRDL are the maximising of energy efficiency and minimising size, whilst simultaneously maintaining the reliability of an instrument that cannot be recovered and is required to survive its lifetime attached to a marine mammal. The CTD-SRDLs record temperature and salinity with an accuracy of better than 0.005 degrees C and 0.02 respectively. However, due to the limited availability of reference data, real-time data from remote places are often associated with slightly higher errors. The potential to collect large numbers of profiles cost-effectively makes data collection using CTD-SRDL technology particularly beneficial in regions where traditional oceanographic measurements are scarce or even absent. Depending on the CTD-SRDL configuration, it is possible to sample and transmit hydrographic profiles on a daily basis, providing valuable and often unique information for a real-time ocean observing system.},

abstract = {With ambitious renewable energy targets, pile driving associated with offshore wind farm construction will become widespread in the marine environment. Many proposed wind farms overlap with the distribution of seals, and sound from pile driving has the potential to cause auditory damage. We report on a behavioural study during the construction of a wind farm using data from GPS/GSM tags on 24 harbour seals Phoca vitulina L. Pile driving data and acoustic propagation models, together with seal movement and dive data, allowed the prediction of auditory damage in each seal. Growth and recovery functions for auditory damage were combined to predict temporary auditory threshold shifts in each seal. Further, M-weighted cumulative sound exposure levels [cSELs(M<inf>pw</inf>)] were calculated and compared to permanent auditory threshold shift exposure criteria for pinnipeds in water exposed to pulsed sounds. The closest distance of each seal to pile driving varied from 4{\textperiodcentered}7 to 40{\textperiodcentered}5 km, and predicted maximum cSELs(M<inf>pw</inf>) ranged from 170{\textperiodcentered}7 to 195{\textperiodcentered}3 dB re 1$\mu$Pa<sup>2</sup>-s for individual seals. Comparison to exposure criteria suggests that half of the seals exceeded estimated permanent auditory damage thresholds. Prediction of auditory damage in marine mammals is a rapidly evolving field and has a number of key uncertainties associated with it. These include how sound propagates in shallow water environments and the effects of pulsed sounds on seal hearing as such, our predictions should be viewed in this context. Policy implications. We predicted that half of the tagged seals received sound levels from pile driving that exceeded auditory damage thresholds for pinnipeds. These results have implications for offshore industry and will be important for policymakers developing guidance for pile driving. Developing engineering solutions to reduce sound levels at source or methods to deter animals from damage risk zones, or changing temporal patterns of piling could potentially reduce auditory damage risk. Future work should focus on validating these predictions by collecting auditory threshold information pre- and post-exposure to pile driving. Ultimately, information on population-level impacts of exposure to pile driving is required to ensure that offshore industry is developed in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

abstract = {The need to balance energy reserves during migration is a critical factor for most long-distance migrants and an important determinant of migratory strategies in birds, insects and land mammals. Large baleen whales migrate annually between foraging and breeding sites, crossing vast ocean areas where food is seldom abundant. How whales respond to the demands and constraints of such long migrations remains unknown. We applied a behaviour discriminating hierarchical state-space model to the satellite tracking data of 12 fin whales and 3 blue whales tagged off the Azores, to investigate their movements, behaviour (transiting and area-restricted search, ARS) and daily activity cycles during the spring migration. Fin and blue whales remained at middle latitudes for prolonged periods, spending most of their time there in ARS behaviour. While near the Azores, fin whale ARS behaviour occurred within a restricted area, with a high degree of overlap among whales. There were noticeable behavioural differences along the migratory pathway of fin whales tracked to higher latitudes: ARS occurred only in the Azores and north of 56°N, whereas in between these areas whales travelled at higher overall speeds while maintaining a nearly direct trajectory. This suggests fin whales may alternate periods of active migration with periods of extended use of specific habitats along the migratory route. ARS behaviour in blue whales occurred over a much wider area as whales slowly progressed northwards. The tracks of these whales terminated still at middle latitudes, before any behavioural switch was detected. Fin whales exhibited behavioural-specific diel rhythms in swimming speed but these varied significantly between geographic areas, possibly due to differences in the day-night cycle across areas. Finally, we show a link between fin whales seen in the Azores and those summering in eastern Greenland-western Iceland along a migratory corridor located in central Atlantic waters.},

abstract = {Diving lung volume and tissue density, reflecting lipid store volume, are important physiological parameters which have only been estimated for a few breath-hold diving species. We outfitted 12 northern bottlenose whales with data loggers which recorded depth, 3-axis acceleration and speed either with a fly-wheel or from change of depth corrected by pitch angle. We fitted measured values of the change in speed during 5s descent and ascent glides to a hydrodynamic model of drag and buoyancy forces using a Bayesian estimation framework. The resulting estimate of diving gas volume was 27.4{\textpm}4.2 (95% credible interval, CI) ml kg-1, closely matching the measured lung capacity of the species. Dive-by-dive variation in gas volume did not correlate with dive depth or duration. Estimated body densities of individuals ranged from 1028.4 to 1033.9 kg m-3 at the sea surface, indicating overall negative tissue buoyancy of this species in seawater. Body density estimates were highly precise with {\textpm}95% credible intervals ranging from 0.1-0.4 kg m-3, which would equate to a precision of <0.5% of lipid content based upon extrapolation from the elephant seal. Six whales tagged near Jan Mayen (Norway, 71{\textdegree} N) had lower body density and were closer to neutral buoyancy than six whales tagged in the Gully (Nova Scotia, Canada, 44{\textdegree} N), a difference which was consistent with the amount of gliding observed during ascent versus descent phases in these animals. Implementation of this approach using longer-duration tags could be used to track longitudinal changes in body density and lipid-store body condition of free-ranging cetaceans.},

abstract = {Long-distance migration has evolved in many organisms moving through different media and using various modes of locomotion and transport. Migration continues to evolve or become suppressed as shown by ongoing dynamic and rapid changes of migration patterns. This great evolutionary flexibility may seem surprising for such a complex attribute as migration. Even if migration in most cases has evolved basically as a strategy to maximise fitness in a seasonal environment, its occurrence and extent depend on a multitude of factors. We give a brief overview of different factors (e.g. physical, geographical, historical, ecological) likely to facilitate and/or constrain the evolution of long-distance migration and discuss how they are likely to affect migration. The basic driving forces for migration are ecological and biogeographic factors like seasonality, spatiotemporal distributions of resources, habitats, predation and competition. The benefit of increased resource availability will be balanced by costs associated with the migratory process in terms of time (incl. losses of prior occupancy advantages), energy and mortality (incl. increased exposure to parasites). Furthermore, migration requires genetic instructions (allowing substantial room for learning in some of the traits) about timing, duration and distance of migration as well as about behavioural and physiological adaptations (fuelling, organ flexibility, locomotion, use of environmental transport etc) and control of orientation and navigation. To what degree these costs and requirements put constraints on migration often depends on body size according to different scaling relationships. From this expose it is clear that research on migration warrants a multitude of techniques and approaches for a complete as possible understanding of a very complex evolutionary syndrome. In addition, we also present examples of migratory distances in a variety of taxons. In recent years new techniques, especially satellite radio telemetry, provide new information of unprecedented accuracy about journeys of individual animals, allowing re-evaluation of migration, locomotion and navigation theories.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Predicting fish stock variations on interannual to decadal time scales is one of the major issues in fisheries science and management. Although the field of marine ecological predictions is still in its infancy, it is understood that a major source of multi-year predictability resides in the ocean. Here we show the first highly skilful long-term predictions of the commercially valuable Barents Sea cod stock. The 7-year predictions are based on the propagation of ocean temperature anomalies from the subpolar North Atlantic toward the Barents Sea, and the strong co-variability between these temperature anomalies and the cod stock. Retrospective predictions for the period 1957-2017 capture well multi-year to decadal variations in cod stock biomass, with cross-validated explained variance of over 60%. For lead times longer than one year the statistical long-term predictions show more skill than operational short-term predictions used in fisheries management and lagged persistence forecasts. Our results thus demonstrate the potential for ecosystem-based fisheries management, which could enable strategic planning on longer time scales. Future predictions show a gradual decline in the cod stock towards 2024.},

abstract = {Loud hydroacoustic sources, such as naval mid-frequency sonars or airguns for marine geophysical prospecting, have been increasingly criticized for their possible negative effects on marine mammals and were implicated in several whale stranding events. Competent authorities now regularly request the implementation of mitigation measures, including the shut-down of acoustic sources when marine mammals are sighted within a predefined exclusion zone. Commonly, ship-based marine mammal observers (MMOs) are employed to visually monitor this zone. This approach is personnel-intensive and not applicable during night time, even though most hydroacoustic activities run day and night. This study describes and evaluates an automatic, ship-based, thermographic whale detection system that continuously scans the ship's environs for whale blows. Its performance is independent of daylight and exhibits an almost uniform, omnidirectional detection probability within a radius of 5 km. It outperforms alerted observers in terms of number of detected blows and ship-whale encounters. Our results demonstrate that thermal imaging can be used for reliable and continuous marine mammal protection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zitterbart et al.},

abstract = {During negative energy balance periods, fatty acids (FAs) are mobilized to cover the metabolic demands of the body. FAs from adipose tissue are selectively mobilized according to their carbon length (CL) and number of double bonds (DBs); however, studies in vivo have focused only on fasting and nonlactating animals. During lactation, UK gray seals fast for 18 d, mobilizing a large amount of lipid from blubber to sustain their own metabolic demands and the nutritional requirements of pups. We investigated FA mobilization in individual gray seal mothers from two UK colonies sampled in 2005 and 2006. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine to what extent the mobilization observed from FAs in blubber can be explained as a function of FAs' CL and number of DBs. FAs were mobilized according to their structure, such that for a given CL, mobilization increased with the number of DBs, and for a given number of DBs, mobilization decreased as CL increased. This pattern of selective mobilization was very similar between colonies, although the relative amounts of component FAs in blubber at early lactation were different between them. FAs, which are considered crucial to pup development, were mobilized more than predicted by the model. This suggests that selective mobilization of FAs is not related solely to the physicochemical characteristics of the FAs but also to the needs of a growing pup.},

abstract = {Several methods have been used to estimate the energy expenditure of free-ranging animals. A relatively new technique uses measures of dynamic body acceleration as a calibrated proxy for energy expenditure and has proved an excellent predictor of energy expenditure in active animals. However, some animals can spend much of their time inactive and still expend energy at varying rates for a range of physiological processes. We tested the utility of dynamic body acceleration to estimate energy expenditure during a range of active (locomotion, eating) and inactive (digesting, thermoregulating) behaviours exhibited by domestic chickens. We also compared this technique with the more established heart-rate method for estimating energy expenditure. During activity, the error of estimation using body acceleration was very similar to that from the heart-rate method. Importantly, our results also showed that body acceleration can be used to estimate energy expenditure when birds are inactive. While the errors surrounding these estimates were greater than those during activity, and those made using the heart-rate method, they were less than those made using interspecific allometric equations. We highlight the importance of selecting a methodology that is appropriate for the life-history of the subject animal. We suggest that, to achieve the greatest possible accuracy and precision when estimating energy expenditure in free-ranging animals, the two techniques should be combined, and both heart rate (f(H)) and dynamic body acceleration could be included as covariates in predictive models. Alternatively, measures of acceleration can be used to ascertain which behaviour is being exhibited at each moment and hence which predictive model should be applied.},

This paper addresses the question of whether a significant relationship between sexual selection and size dimorphism exists in a comparative context. Thus, harem size and body size data gathered from the literature were analysed with independent contrasts analyses. These investigations showed that sexual size dimorphism is not a consequence of an allometric relationship between male and female size. Instead, there is a clear relationship between harem size and sexual size dimorphism. Further analyses also revealed a significant relationship between harem size and male size whereas no such relationship existed for females. These results support the hypothesis that sexual size dimorphism in pinnipeds is the product of an exclusively male response to sexual selection.},

abstract = {In northern Fennoscandia, the spatial and temporal grazing practices of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) vary, which implies different grazing effects dependent on natural conditions as well as management regime (i.e., timing and intensity of grazing). We compared density and biomass of main plant groups in semi-dry mountain birch forests exposed to either long-term summer or winter grazing in three reindeer herding districts in the northernmost Finland. Percent plant cover, height, and biomass of reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) and dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium uliginosum, Calluna vulgaris, and Betula nana) were lower on summer ranges compared with winter ranges. The biomass of other dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea), and graminoids and herbs, and the % cover of non-vegetated bare soil and litter were, however, higher on summer ranges than on winter ranges. Young mountain birch shoots (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) were less frequent on summer ranges than on winter ranges. The total leaf biomass under the browsing height of reindeer (<1.5 m) was also lower on summer ranges compared with winter ranges. Especially in drier and nutrient poor mountain birch forests, intensive summer grazing reduces the quantity of lichens and total plant biomass which affects the ecological state and productivity of these forests and also reduces especially their winter grazing value for reindeer. Therefore, in addition to regulating the maximum sustained numbers of reindeer, pasture rotation systems that effectively protect dry and nutrient poor vegetation from summer grazing and trampling should be encouraged.},

abstract = {A key component in understanding the ecological role of marine mammal predators is to identify how, where and how much prey they capture in time and space. Satellite and archival tags on pinnipeds generally only provide diving and positioning information, and foraging is often inferred to take place in particular shaped dives or when the animal remains in an area for an extended interval. However, fast movements of the head and jaws may provide reliable feeding cues that can be detected by small low-power accelerometers mounted on the head. To test this notion, a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) was trained to wear an OpenTag (sampling at 200 or 333 Hz with ±2 or ±16 g clipping) on its head while catching fish prey in front of four underwater digital high-speed video cameras. We show that both raptorial and suction feeding generate jerk (i.e., differential of acceleration) signatures with maximum peak values exceeding 1000 m/s3. We conclude that reliable prey capture cues can be derived from fast-sampling, head mounted accelerometer tags thus holding a promising potential for long-term studies of foraging ecology and field energetics of aquatic predators in their natural environments.},

abstract = {Many baleen whales undertake annual fasting and feeding cycles, resulting in substantial changes in their body condition, an important factor affecting fitness. As a measure of lipid-store body condition, tissue density of a few deep diving marine mammals has been estimated using a hydrodynamic glide model of drag and buoyancy forces. Here, we applied the method to shallow-diving humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in North Atlantic and Antarctic feeding aggregations. High-resolution 3-axis acceleration, depth and speed data were collected from 24 whales. Measured values of acceleration during 5 s glides were fitted to a hydrodynamic glide model to estimate unknown parameters (tissue density, drag term and diving gas volume) in a Bayesian framework. Estimated species-average tissue density (1031.6 ± 2.1 kg m-3, ±95% credible interval) indicates that humpback whale tissue is typically negatively buoyant although there was a large inter-individual variation ranging from 1025.2 to 1043.1 kg m-3. The precision of the individual estimates was substantially finer than the variation across different individual whales, demonstrating a progressive decrease in tissue density throughout the feeding season and comparably high lipid-store in pregnant females. The drag term (CDAm-1) was estimated to be relatively high, indicating a large effect of lift-related induced drag for humpback whales. Our results show that tissue density of shallow diving baleen whales can be estimated using the hydrodynamic gliding model, although cross-validation with other techniques is an essential next step. This method for estimating body condition is likely to be broadly applicable across a range of aquatic animals and environments.},

abstract = {1. Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2. The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 production (VCO2) in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. VO2 and VCO2 were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4. Both VO2 and VCO2 were significantly positively associated with ODBA in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of ODBA can be used to estimate VO2 and VCO2 and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and CO2, that ODBA can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5. To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured ODBA in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared ODBA during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in ODBA during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6. In free-living imperial cormorants, ODBA, and hence estimated VO2, was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.},

abstract = {In animal ecology, a question of key interest for aquatic species is how changes in movement behavior are related in the horizontal and vertical dimensions when individuals forage. Alternative theoretical models and inconsistent empirical findings mean that this question remains unresolved. Here we tested expectations by incorporating the vertical dimension (dive information) when predicting switching between movement states (“resident” or “directed”) within a state-space model. We integrated telemetry-based tracking and diving data available for four seal species (southern elephant, Weddell, antarctic fur, and crabeater) in East Antarctica. Where possible, we included dive variables derived from the relationships between (1) dive duration and depth (as a measure of effort), and (2) dive duration and the postdive surface interval (as a physiological measure of cost). Our results varied within and across species, but there was a general tendency for the probability of switching into “resident” state to be positively associated with shorter dive durations (for a given depth) and longer postdive surface intervals (for a given dive duration). Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that simplistic interpretations of optimal foraging theory based only on horizontal movements do not directly translate into the vertical dimension in dynamic marine environments. Analyses that incorporate at least two dimensions can test more sophisticated models of foraging behavior.},

abstract = {Miniature electronic data recorders and transmitters have revolutionized the way we study animals over the past decades, particularly marine animals at sea. But, very recently, animal-borne instruments have also been designed and implemented that provide in situ hydrographic data from parts of the oceans where little or no other data are currently available (even from beneath the ice in polar regions). Ocean data is delivered from animal-borne instruments via satellites in near real-time, which would enrich the Global Ocean Observing System if animal-borne instruments were deployed systematically. In the last 10 years, studies involving more than 10 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Greenland, Norway, South Africa, UK, USA) have demonstrated how highly accurate oceanographic sensors, integrated into standard animal, biologging instruments, can provide data of equal or better quality than XBT/XCTD data. Here, we present some of the pioneering studies and demonstrate that we now have enough information for many marine species to predict where they will go within reasonable limits. Thus, we can direct sampling effort to particularly interesting and productive regions and maximize data return. In the future, biologging could certainly play an important part in the Global Ocean Observing System, by providing complementary data to more traditional sampling technologies - especially in the high latitudes. This paper will make a core contribution to the Plenary Sessions 4A, 4B and 5A and will be relevant to 2A, 2B and 3A.},

It is thought that diving predators optimize their foraging success when oxygen use and energy gain act as competing currencies, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested because it has been difficult to measure the quality of prey that is targeted by free-ranging animals. We used high-resolution multisensor digital tags attached to foraging blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) with concurrent acoustic prey measurements to quantify foraging performance across depth and prey density gradients. We parameterized two competing physiological models to estimate energy gain and expenditure based on foraging decisions. Our analyses show that at low prey densities, blue whale feeding rates and energy intake were low to minimize oxygen use, but at higher prey densities feeding frequency increased to maximize energy intake. Contrary to previous paradigms, we demonstrate that blue whales are not indiscriminate grazers but instead switch foraging strategies in response to variation in prey density and depth to maximize energetic efficiency.},

Sea ice spreads over vast areas and has major impacts on the rest of the climate system, reflecting solar radiation and restricting ocean/atmosphere exchanges.

The rapid decreases reduced the Antarctic sea ice extents to their lowest values in the 40-y record, both on a yearly average basis (record low in 2017) and on a monthly basis (record low in February 2017).Following over 3 decades of gradual but uneven increases in sea ice coverage, the yearly average Antarctic sea ice extents reached a record high of 12.8 {\texttimes} 106 km2 in 2014, followed by a decline so precipitous that they reached their lowest value in the 40-y 1979{\textendash}2018 satellite multichannel passive-microwave record, 10.7 {\texttimes} 106 km2, in 2017. In contrast, it took the Arctic sea ice cover a full 3 decades to register a loss that great in yearly average ice extents. Still, when considering the 40-y record as a whole, the Antarctic sea ice continues to have a positive overall trend in yearly average ice extents, although at 11,300 {\textpm} 5,300 km2.y-1, this trend is only 50\% of the trend for 1979{\textendash}2014, before the precipitous decline. Four of the 5 sectors into which the Antarctic sea ice cover is divided all also have 40-y positive trends that are well reduced from their 2014{\textendash}2017 values. The one anomalous sector in this regard, the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has a 40-y negative trend, with the yearly average ice extents decreasing overall in the first 3 decades, reaching a minimum in 2007, and exhibiting an overall upward trend since 2007 (i.e., reflecting a reversal in the opposite direction from the other 4 sectors and the Antarctic sea ice cover as a whole).},

abstract = {Marine turtles are globally threatened. Crucial for the conservation of these large ectotherms is a detailed knowledge of their energy relationships, especially their at-sea metabolic rates, which will ultimately define population structure and size. Measuring metabolic rates in free-ranging aquatic animals, however, remains a challenge. Hence, it is not surprising that for most marine turtle species we know little about the energetic requirements of adults at sea. Recently, accelerometry has emerged as a promising tool for estimating activity-specific metabolic rates of animals in the field. Accelerometry allows quantification of the movement of animals (ODBA/PDBA, overall/partial dynamic body acceleration), which, after calibration, might serve as a proxy for metabolic rate. We measured oxygen consumption rates (V(O(2))) of adult green turtles (Chelonia mydas; 142.1±26.9 kg) at rest and when swimming within a 13 m-long swim channel, using flow-through respirometry. We investigated the effect of water temperature (T(w)) on turtle and tested the hypothesis that turtle body acceleration can be used as a proxy for V(O(2)). Mean mass-specific V(O(2)) (sV(O(2))) of six turtles when resting at a T(w) of 25.8±1.0°C was 0.50±0.09 ml min(-1) kg(-0.83). sV(O(2))increased significantly with T(w) and activity level. Changes in sV(O(2)) were paralleled by changes in respiratory frequency (f(R)). Deploying bi-axial accelerometers in conjunction with respirometry, we found a significant positive relationship between sV(O(2)) and PDBA that was modified by T(w). The resulting predictive equation was highly significant (r(2)=0.83, P<0.0001) and associated error estimates were small (mean algebraic error 3.3%), indicating that body acceleration is a good predictor of V(O(2)) in green turtles. Our results suggest that accelerometry is a suitable method to investigate marine turtle energetics at sea.},

abstract = {Many marine animals use sound passively or actively for communication, foraging, predator avoidance, navigation, and to sense their environment. The advent of acoustic recording tags has allowed biologists to get the on-animal perspective of the sonic environment and, in combination with movement sensors, to relate sounds to the activities of the tagged animal. These powerful tools have led to a wide range of insights into the behaviour of marine animals and have opened new opportunities for studying the ways they interact with their environment. Acoustic tags demand new analysis methods and careful experimental design to optimize the consistency between research objectives and the realistic performance of the tags. Technical details to consider are the suitability of the tag attachment to a given species, the accuracy of the tag sensors, and the recording and attachment duration of the tag. Here we consider the achievements, potential, and limitations of acoustic recording tags in studying the behaviour, habitat use and sensory ecology of marine mammals, the taxon to which this technology has been most often applied. We examine the application of acoustic tags to studies of vocal behaviour, foraging ecology, acoustic tracking, and the effects of noise to assess both the breadth of applications and the specific issues that arise in each. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

The assumed climate, eutrophication and cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries scenarios modified seal predation impacts on fish. Fish biomass and catches are more affected by fishing mortality and the environment than by seal predation. Our results highlight that the impacts of the increasing seal population on lower trophic levels are complex; thus, we emphasize the need to consider a range of possible ecosystem contexts when evaluating potential impacts of top predators.

Recruitment to the stock during the late 1980s was poor, mainly due to the nearly complete absence of year-classes 1986, 1987 and 1988. Data from reproductive organs of Barents Sea harp seals, with corresponding age determinations, were analysed in combined samples collected during three periods: 1963-1972, 1976-1985 and 1990-1993. The available size-at-age data suggest decreased growth rates and reduced maximum lengths for both sexes in 1990-1993. Testes weights and volumes indicate that males attained sexual maturity in age-groups 6-9 years during 1990-1993. Testes volumes also indicate an apparent increase in age at sexual maturity for males from age-groups 4-7 years in the combined 1963-1972 sample. Cumulative maturity frequencies, based on ages at first ovulations as indicated by corpora lutea and albicantia formed within the two years prior to the year of capture, show that the apparent mean age of maturity for females increased significantly from 5.5 years in the 1963-1972 sample to 6.7 years in 1976-1985 and 8.1 years in 1990-1993. A limited number of mature females, sampled after implantation in September-October 1990-1993, indicate a rate of early pregnancies of about 0.84. Indirect analyses of fertilities (using size-sequences of corpora in the ovaries) suggest an appreciable reduction in fecundity of females during the past 30 years. The observed changes in life history parameters are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are among the most proficient of mammalian divers and are a major component of the Antarctic food web. Yet little is known of their movements or interaction with their oceanic environment. Specially designed satellite-link data loggers allowed us to visualize the 3-D movements of elephant seals as they swam rapidly from South Georgia to distant (up to 2650 km) areas of Antarctic continental shelf. One seal dived continuously to the sea bed in one small area for a month, implying consumption of benthic prey. Dives here were shorter even though average swimming velocity was lower. It is suggested that the physiological requirements of feeding and digestion reduced the aerobic dive limit. Long distance travel to relocatable hydrographic or topographical features, such as shelf breaks, may allow large predators to locate rev more consistently than from mid-ocean searches.},

abstract = {Many diving seabirds and marine mammals have been found to regularly exceed their theoretical aerobic dive limit (TADL). No animals have been found to dive for durations that are consistently shorter than their TADL. We attached time-depth recorders to 7 blue whales and 15 fin whales (family Balaenopteridae). The diving behavior of both species was similar, and we distinguished between foraging and traveling dives. Foraging dives in both species were deeper, longer in duration and distinguished by a series of vertical excursions where lunge feeding presumably occurred. Foraging blue whales lunged 2.4 ( ± 1.13) times per dive, with a maximum of six times and average vertical excursion of 30.2 ( ± 10.04) m. Foraging fin whales lunged 1.7 ( ± 0.88) times per dive, with a maximum of eight times and average vertical excursion of 21.2 ( ± 4.35) m. The maximum rate of ascent of lunges was higher than the maximum rate of descent in both species, indicating that feeding lunges occurred on ascent. Foraging dives were deeper and longer than non-feeding dives in both species. On average, blue whales dived to 140.0 ( ± 46.01) m and 7.8 ( ± 1.89) min when foraging, and 67.6 ( ± 51.46) m and 4.9 ( ± 2.53) min when not foraging. Fin whales dived to 97.9 ( ± 32.59) m and 6.3 ( ± 1.53) min when foraging and to 59.3 ( ± 29.67) m and 4.2 ( ± 1.67) min when not foraging. The longest dives recorded for both species, 14.7 min for blue whales and 16.9 min for fin whales, were considerably shorter than the TADL of 31.2 and 28.6 min, respectively. An allometric comparison of seven families diving to an average depth of 80-150 m showed a significant relationship between body mass and dive duration once Balaenopteridae whales, with a mean dive duration of 6.8 min, were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the short dive durations of blue whales and fin whales cannot be explained by the shallow distribution of their prey. We propose instead that short duration diving in large whales results from either: (1) dispersal behavior of prey; or (2) a high energetic cost of foraging. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The ability to measure the energy expenditure of free-ranging animals is of great importance but the techniques available each have their limitations. Recently, as an alternative to more established techniques, an integrated measure of body acceleration termed overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) has been used as a calibrated proxy for rate of oxygen consumption (V(O(2))) and hence metabolic rate. The present study tested the potential of this technique, firstly by expanding the range of species for which the V(O(2))-ODBA relationship has been defined and secondly by undertaking a validation exercise to explore the accuracy of predictions made using ODBA. V(O(2))-ODBA relationships during terrestrial locomotion were established for several bipedal and quadrupedal endotherms and compiled with similar relationships previously determined in other species. A model incorporating all of these species showed that ODBA is an excellent predictor of V(O(2)) but there is variation in the V(O(2))-ODBA relationship between species, and further variation within some species. Including measurements such as body mass and structural size in prediction equations might further improve the predictive power of the 'ODBA technique' and eliminate species-specific differences. In the validation exercise, estimate errors were calculated for the species-specific predictive equations. The use of ODBA to estimate V(O(2)) was valid across all species examined and may show a greater potential for estimating energy expenditure for individual animals than other techniques.},

Improving the knowledge of the distribution and abundance of this poorly known group is an essential prerequisite to inform mitigation strategies seeking to minimize their spatial and temporal overlap with human activities. We provide for the first time abundance estimates for five deep diving cetacean species (sperm whale, long-finned pilot whale, northern bottlenose whale, Cuvier's beaked whale and Sowerby's beaked whale) using data from three dedicated cetacean sighting surveys that covered the oceanic and shelf waters of the North-East Atlantic. Density surface modelling was used to obtain model-based estimates of abundance and to explore the physical and biological characteristics of the habitat used by these species. Distribution of all species was found to be significantly related to depth, distance from the 2000m depth contour, the contour index (a measure of variability in the seabed) and sea surface temperature. Predicted distribution maps also suggest that there is little spatial overlap between these species. Our results represent the best abundance estimates for deep-diving whales in the North-East Atlantic, predict areas of high density during summer and constitute important baseline information to guide future risk assessments of human activities on these species, evaluate potential spatial and temporal trends and inform EU Directives and future conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Productive tundra plant communities composed of a variety of fast growing herbaceous and woody plants are likely to attract mammalian herbivores. Such vegetation is likely to respond to different-sized herbivores more rapidly than currently acknowledged from the tundra. Accentuated by currently changing populations of arctic mammals there is a need to understand impacts of different-sized herbivores on the dynamics of productive tundra plant communities. Here we assess the differential effects of ungulate (reindeer) and small rodent herbivores (voles and lemmings) on high productive tundra vegetation. A spatially extensive exclosure experiment was run for three years on river sediment plains along two river catchments in low-arctic Norway. The river catchments were similar in species pools but differed in species abundance composition of both plants and vertebrate herbivores. Biomass of forbs, deciduous shrubs and silica-poor grasses increased by 40-50% in response to release from herbivory, whereas biomass of silica-rich grasses decreased by 50-75%. Hence both additive and compensatory effects of small rodents and reindeer exclusion caused these significant changes in abundance composition of the plant communities. Changes were also rapid, evident after only one growing season, and are among the fastest and strongest ever documented in Arctic vegetation. The rate of changes indicates a tight link between the dynamics of productive tundra vegetation and both small and large herbivores. Responses were however not spatially consistent, being highly different between the catchments. We conclude that despite similar species pools, variation in plant species abundance and herbivore species dynamics give different prerequisites for change.},

abstract = {Changes in buoyancy during an animal's time at sea are a powerful tool for inferring spatial and temporal foraging success. Buoyancy can be difficult to measure, but in some species of seal, drift components of dives can be used. We used swim speed data from adult female southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina using geo-locating velocity-time-depth recorders during 2004 post-lactation (PL; n = 7) and 2002, 2004 and 2005 post-moult (PM; n = 18) foraging trips to detect periods of passive drifting during diving. In addition to the characteristic drift dives of elephant seals, drifting also occurred during putative foraging dives. We used generalised linear models (GLMs) to examine the relationship between body lipid content measured on land and several diving variables collected within a week of these measurements being taken. The strongest support (deviance explained = 90%) was for the model including drift rate (77%), seal length (12%) and descent rate (2%). Estimates of body lipid, based on the GLM, were predicted for each day of the foraging trips. Areas where seals increased their relative lipid content from one day to the next corresponded well with areas in which the seals spent the greatest amount of time. Inferring foraging success from positive changes in drift rate has so far been limited to elephant seals which perform characteristic drift dives, but the addition of swim speed data to detect short periods of stationary behaviour allows for this method to be expanded to a greater range of ocean predators. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

We explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole-ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress), additive (no additional stress), or antagonistic (reduced stress). Individually, only ocean acidification had a negative effect on total biomass. Fishing and ocean warming and ocean warming with ocean acidification had an additive effect on biomass. Adding fishing to ocean warming and ocean acidification significantly changed the direction and magnitude of the interaction effect to a synergistic response on biomass. The interaction effect depended on the response level examined (ecosystem vs. community). For communities, the size, direction, and type of interaction effect varied depending on the combination of stressors. Top predator and fish biomass had a synergistic response to the interaction of all three stressors, whereas biomass of benthic invertebrates responded antagonistically. With our approach, we were able to identify the regional effects of fishing on the size and direction of the interacting effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification.},

Blubber and muscle samples from 93 harp seals and 20 minke whales were collected in the southern Barents Sea in May 2011. The study showed that harp seals were at a higher trophic level than minke whales during spring. This supported previous diet studies suggesting a more fish-dominant diet for seals, as compared with the whales, at this time of the year. The stable isotopes and fatty acids indicated niche separation between the seals and the whales, and between different age groups of the harp seals. Older seals had fatty acid profiles more equal to minke whales as compared with younger seals. Furthermore, while the fatty acid profiles su...},

abstract = {The Eastern Weddell Sea is characterized by narrow continental shelves and Warm Deep Water (WDW) is located in close proximity to the ice shelves in this region. The exchange of WDW across the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) determines the rate of basal ice shelf melting. Here, we present a unique data set consisting of 2351 vertical profiles of temperature and salinity collected by southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) and a profile beneath the Fimbul Ice Shelf (FIS), obtained via drilling through 395 m of ice. This data set reveals variations in salinity and temperature through winter, and using a conceptual model of the coastal salt budget we quantify the main exchange processes. Our data show that modified WDW, with temperatures below -1.5 degrees C, is advected onto the shelf and into the ice shelf cavities by an eddy overturning of the ASF. The onshore Ekman flux of surface waters during summer is the main source of freshwater that leads to the formation of low salinity shelf waters in the region. The modified WDW that reaches beneath the ice shelves is too cold for basal ice shelf melting to create such low salinity water. A high-resolution model of an idealized ASF-continental shelf-ice shelf system supports the conclusions from the data analysis. The inflow of WDW onto the continental shelf and into the ice shelf cavity occurs within a bottom boundary layer where the eddy advection in the model is particularly strong, in close agreement with the observed vertical profile of temperature beneath the FIS.},

abstract = {Efficient locomotion between prey resources at depth and oxygen at the surface is crucial for breath-hold divers to maximize time spent in the foraging layer, and thereby net energy intake rates. The body density of divers, which changes with body condition, determines the apparent weight (buoyancy) of divers, which may affect round-trip cost-of-transport (COT) between the surface and depth. We evaluated alternative predictions from external-work and actuator-disc theory of how non-neutral buoyancy affects round-trip COT to depth, and the minimum COT speed for steady-state vertical transit. Not surprisingly, the models predict that one-way COT decreases (increases) when buoyancy aids (hinders) one-way transit. At extreme deviations from neutral buoyancy, gliding at terminal velocity is the minimum COT strategy in the direction aided by buoyancy. In the transit direction hindered by buoyancy, the external-work model predicted that minimum COT speeds would not change at greater deviations from neutral buoyancy, but minimum COT speeds were predicted to increase under the actuator disc model. As previously documented for grey seals, we found that vertical transit rates of 36 elephant seals increased in both directions as body density deviated from neutral buoyancy, indicating that actuator disc theory may more closely predict the power requirements of divers affected by gravity than an external work model. For both models, minor deviations from neutral buoyancy did not affect minimum COT speed or round-trip COT itself. However, at body-density extremes, both models predict that savings in the aided direction do not fully offset the increased COT imposed by the greater thrusting required in the hindered direction.},

abstract = {TMB is an open source R package that enables quick implementation of complex nonlinear random effect (latent variable) models in a manner similar to the established AD Model Builder package (ADMB, admb-project.org). In addition, it offers easy access to parallel computations. The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects ($\sim$10^6) and parameters ($\sim$10^3). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

abstract = {Development of adequate diving capabilities is crucial for survival of seal pups and may depend on age and body size. We tracked the diving behavior of 20 gray seal pups during their first 3 mo at sea using satellite relay data loggers. We employed quantile analysis to track upper limits of dive duration and percentage time spent diving, and lower limits of surface intervals. When pups first left the breeding colony, extreme (ninety-fifth percentile) dive duration and percentage time spent diving were positively correlated with age, but not mass, at departure. Extreme dive durations and percentage time spent diving peaked at [Formula: see text] d of age at values comparable with those of adults, but were not sustained. Greater peaks in extreme percentage time spent diving occurred in pups that had higher initial values, were older at their peak, and were heavier at departure. Pups that were smaller and less capable divers when they left the colony improved extreme dive durations and percentage time spent diving more rapidly, once they were at sea. Minimum survival time correlated positively with departure mass. Pups that were heavier at weaning thus benefitted from being both larger and older at departure, but smaller pups faced a trade-off. While age at departure had a positive effect on early dive performance, departure mass impacted on peak percentage time spent diving and longer-term survival. We speculate that once small pups have attained a minimum degree of physiological development to support diving, they would benefit by leaving the colony when younger but larger to maximize limited fuel reserves, rather than undergoing further maturation on land away from potential food resources, because poor divers may be able to "catch up" once at sea.},

Some of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis has come from telemetry data for sharks, bony fish, sea turtles and penguins. Here, I show that the programming for these L{\'{e}}vy movement patterns does not need to be very sophisticated or clever on the predator's part, as these movement patterns would arise naturally if the predators change their direction of travel only after encountering patches of relatively strong turbulence (a seemingly natural response to buffeting). This is established with the aid of kinematic simulations of three-dimensional turbulence. L{\'{e}}vy flights movement patterns are predicted to arise in all but the most quiescent of oceanic waters.},

abstract = {Results from 84 deployments of time-depth recorders on southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, at Macquarie Island are discussed. With loss and failure of instruments, data were collected from 31 seals: 14 postmolt females, 9 postbreeding females, 3 postmolt males, and 5 postbreeding males. Water temperature data, also collected by the diving instruments, indicated that the major foraging areas of adult elephant seals from Macquarie Island were located in Antarctic waters and that males used areas over the Antarctic continental shelf, while females tended to inhabit deeper, offshore waters. Some individuals of either sex, however, spent the majority of their time in warmer waters associated with the Antarctic Polar Front or over the northern Campbell Plateau. Approximately 90% of the time at sea was spent submerged, with times on the surface generally less than 10 minutes. Five characteristic dive types were identified, the most common of which were type 1 and type 2 dives. Both types are characterized by rapid descent to a depth followed by a protracted time at that depth interspersed with a number of small "wiggles," in turn followed by a rapid ascent to the surface. Type 1 dives exhibited marked diurnal variation, while type 2 dives showed no such variation and were usually in long sequences of very similar depths. We interpret type 1 as pelagic foraging dives and type 2 as benthic foraging dives. Type 2 dives were almost exclusively made by males while over the continental shelf. Type 1 dives were made by all animals. The majority of dives made by southern elephant seals are characteristically deep (maximum depth = 1,430 m) and long (maximum duration = 120 min.). Estimated aerobic dive limits (ADL) were rarely exceeded by males or postbreeding females, but 44% of all dives made by postmolt (and, therefore, gestating) females exceeded ADL. Females in the last two trimesters of gestation performed the longest dives and most often exceeded ADL, suggesting that the estimated ADL is being underestimated in these animals and that these animals are making physiological adjustments that increase oxygen stores or reduce oxygen consumption},

abstract = {How predators find, select and capture prey is central to understanding trophic cascades and ecosystem structure. But despite advances in biologging technology, obtaining in situ observations of organisms and their interactions remains challenging in the marine environment. For some species of toothed whales, echoes from organisms insonified by echolocation clicks and recorded by sound logging tags have provided a fine-scale view of prey density, and predator and prey behaviour during capture attempts, but such information is not available for marine predators that do not echolocate. Here the development and performance of a miniature biomimetic sonar and movement tag capable of acquiring similar data from non-echolocating marine predators is reported. The tag, weighing 200 g in air, records wide bandwidth sonar data at up to 50 pings a second synchronously with fast-sampling sensors for depth, acceleration, magnetic field and GPS. This sensor suite enables biotic conditions and predator behaviour to be related to geographic location over long-duration foraging trips by apex marine predators. The sonar operates at 1.5 MHz with a 3.4° beamwidth and a source level of 190 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa at 1 m. Sonar recordings from a trial deployment of the tag on a southern elephant seal contained frequent targets corresponding to small organisms up to 6 m ahead of the tagged animal. Synchronously sampled movement data allowed interpretation of whether the seal attempted to capture organisms that it approached closely while the high sonar ping rate revealed attempts by prey to escape. Results from this trial demonstrate the ability of the tag to quantify the biotic environment and to track individual prey captures, providing fine-scale information on predator-prey interactions which has been difficult to obtain from non-echolocating marine animals.},

abstract = {A dedicated aerial cetacean survey was conducted concurrently to a standardised net trawl survey for krill in order to investigate distribution patterns of large whales and different krill species and to investigate relationships of these. Distance sampling data were used to produce density surface models for humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) around the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Abundance for both species was estimated over two strata in the Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage. Distinct distribution patterns suggest horizontal niche partitioning of the two whale species around the WAP, with fin whales aggregating at the shelf edge of the South Shetland Islands in the Drake Passage and humpback whales in the Bransfield Strait. Krill biomass estimated from the concurrent krill survey was used along with CTD data from the same expedition, bathymetric parameters and satellite data on chlorophyll-a and ice concentration to model krill distribution. Comparisons of the predicted distributions of both whale species with the predicted distributions of Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias and Thysanoessa macrura suggest a complex relationship rather than a straightforward correlation between krill and whales. However, results indicate that fin whales were feeding in an area dominated by T. macrura, while humpback whales were found in areas of higher E. superba biomass. Our results provide abundance estimates for humpback whales and, for the first time, fin whales in the WAP and contribute important information on feeding ecology and habitat use of these two species in the Southern Ocean.},

The probability that an individual uses a given resource, as characterized by environmental factors, can be quantified in terms of the resource selection probability function (RSPF). The present literature on the topic has claimed that, except when both used and unused sites are known, the RSPF is non-estimable and that only a function proportional to RSPF, namely, the resource selection function (RSF) can be estimated. This paper describes a close connection between the estimation of the RSPF and the estimation of the weight function in the theory of weighted distributions. This connection can be used to obtain fully efficient, maximum likelihood estimators of the resource selection probability function under commonly used survey designs in wildlife management. The method is illustrated using GPS collar data for mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus de Blainville 1816) in northwest British Columbia, Canada.},

Estimating and decomposing total uncertainty for survey‐based abundance estimates of Norwegian spring‐spawning herring. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: –. A method is developed to quantify the uncertainty of abundance and age-specific abundance estimates of Norwegian spring-spawning herring, accounting for the combined effect of several error sources. We present an abundance estimate adjusted for vessel avoidance, acoustic shadowing, and depth-dependent target strength, and highlight the potentially dramatic combined effect of these adjustments. Uncertainty in this estimate is affected by the precision of the adjustment formulae as well as by the sampling errors in acoustic and trawl measurements. This total uncertainty is decomposed into contributions from each source. Here, the method is applied to data from surveys on the overwintering stock in the Vestfjord system and off Vesteraalen in northern Norway in November/December of the years 2001–2004.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding by rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) is associated with a high energetic cost that decreases diving capacity, thereby limiting access to dense prey patches at depth. Despite this cost, rorquals exhibit high rates of lipid deposition and extremely large maximum body size. To address this paradox, we integrated kinematic data from digital tags with unsteady hydrodynamic models to estimate the energy budget for lunges and foraging dives of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest rorqual and living mammal. Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales. These results highlight the importance of high prey density, regardless of prey patch depth, for efficient bulk filter feeding in baleen whales and may explain some diel changes in foraging behavior in rorqual whales.},

abstract = {1. Digital tags were used to describe diving and vocal behaviour of sperm whales during 198 complete and partial foraging dives made by 37 individual sperm whales in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Ligurian Sea. 2. The maximum depth of dive averaged by individual differed across the three regions and was 985 m (SD = 124.3), 644 m (123.4) and 827 m (60.3), respectively. An average dive cycle consisted of a 45 min (6.3) dive with a 9 min (3.0) surface interval, with no significant differences among regions. On average, whales spent greater than 72% of their time in foraging dive cycles. 3. Whales produced regular clicks for 81% (4.1) of a dive and 64% (14.6) of the descent phase. The occurrence of buzz vocalizations (also called 'creaks') as an indicator of the foraging phase of a dive showed no difference in mean prey capture attempts per dive between regions [18 buzzes/dive (7.6)]. Sperm whales descended a mean of 392 m (144) from the start of regular clicking to the first buzz, which supports the hypothesis that regular clicks function as a long-range biosonar. 4. There were no significant differences in the duration of the foraging phase [28 min (6.0)] or percentage of the dive duration in the foraging phase [62% (7.3)] between the three regions, with an overall average proportion of time spent actively encountering prey during dive cycles of 0.53 (0.05). Whales maintained their time in the foraging phase by decreasing transit time for deeper foraging dives. 5. Similarity in foraging behaviour in the three regions and high diving efficiencies suggest that the success of sperm whales as mesopelagic predators is due in part to long-range echolocation of deep prey patches, efficient locomotion and a large aerobic capacity during diving.},

abstract = {Elephant seals regularly perform dives during which they spend a large proportion of time drifting passively through the water column. The rate of vertical change in depth during these 'drift' dives is largely a result of the proportion of lipid tissue in the body, with fatter seals having higher (more positive or less negative) drift rates compared with leaner seals. We examined the temporal changes in drift rates of 24 newly weaned southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups during their first trip to sea to determine if this easily recorded dive characteristic can be used to continuously monitor changes in body composition of seals throughout their foraging trips. All seals demonstrated a similar trend over time: drift rates were initially positive but decreased steadily over the first 30-50 days after departure (Phase 1), corresponding to seals becoming gradually less buoyant. Over the following similar to100 days (Phase 2), drift rates again increased gradually, while during the last similar to20-45 days (Phase 3) drift rates either remained constant or decreased slightly. The daily rate of change in drift rate was negatively related to the daily rate of horizontal displacement (daily travel rate), and daily travel rates of more than similar to80 km were almost exclusively associated with negative changes in drift rate. We developed a mechanistic model based on body compositions and morphometrics measured in the field, published values for the density of seawater and various body components, and values of drag coefficients for objects of different shapes. We used this model to examine the theoretical relationships between drift rate and body composition and carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify errors and biases caused by varying model parameters. While variations in seawater density and uncertainties in estimated body surface area and volume are unlikely to result in errors in estimated lipid content of more than +/-2.5%, variations in drag coefficient can lead to errors of greater than or equal to10%. Finally, we compared the lipid contents predicted by our model with the lipid contents measured using isotopically labelled water and found a strong positive correlation. The best-fitting model suggests that the drag coefficient of seals while drifting passively is between similar to0.49 (roughly corresponding to a sphere-shaped object) and 0.69 (a prolate spheroid), and we were able to estimate relative lipid content to within approximately +/-2% lipid. Our results suggest that this simple method can be used to estimate the changes in lipid content of free-ranging seals while at sea and may help improve our understanding of the foraging strategies of these important marine predators.},

Ovulation rates of adult females were high and similar to rates recorded from studies of ringed seals in other geographic areas. However, pregnancy rates averaged only 55% and were significantly lower than in other studies, and the proportions of young-of-the-year were only 4.8, 4.2, 7.5, 4.1, and 23% for the mentioned years, respectively, instead of being >30% as expected. These results appear to indicate that reproductive parameters of ringed seals and survival of their young are exhibiting longterm shifts rather than short-term fluctuations, and that the trend is downward. Furthermore, these downward trends in reproduction, in conjunction with changes in the proportions of different seal species in the diet of polar bears, climatic warming in western Hudson Bay, and progressively earlier breakup of sea ice over the last 25 years, suggest that major changes are occurring in the marine ecosystem of Hudson Bay. The pathways involved are poorly understood and merit further study.},

abstract = {Historical harvesting pushed many whale species to the brink of extinction. Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures—historical commercial whaling and future climate change—on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate–biological coupled “Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments” (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.},

abstract = {Marine top predators such as seabirds are useful indicators of the integrated response of the marine ecosystem to environmental variability at different scales. Large-scale physical gradients constrain seabird habitat. Birds however respond behaviourally to physical heterogeneity at much smaller scales. Here, we use, for the first time, three-dimensional GPS tracking of a seabird, the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), in the Mozambique Channel. These data, which provide at the same time high-resolution vertical and horizontal positions, allow us to relate the behaviour of frigatebirds to the physical environment at the (sub-)mesoscale (10-100 km, days-weeks). Behavioural patterns are classified based on the birds' vertical displacement (e.g. fast/slow ascents and descents), and are overlaid on maps of physical properties of the ocean-atmosphere interface, obtained by a nonlinear analysis of multi-satellite data. We find that frigatebirds modify their behaviours concurrently to transport and thermal fronts. Our results suggest that the birds' co-occurrence with these structures is a consequence of their search not only for food (preferentially searched over thermal fronts) but also for upward vertical wind. This is also supported by their relationship with mesoscale patterns of wind divergence. Our multi-disciplinary method can be applied to forthcoming high-resolution animal tracking data, and aims to provide a mechanistic understanding of animals' habitat choice and of marine ecosystem responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {The use of biologging instruments has greatly improved our understanding of the behaviour, physiology and ecology of free-ranging marine mammals. However, handling wild animals and attaching instruments to streamlined bodies can cause stress and potentially influence behaviour and swimming/diving energetics. The goals of this study, undertaken on Bouvet{\o}ya, were (1) to determine if the first trip to sea after instrumentation is representative of subsequent trips in lactating Antarctic fur seals, to explore potential handling effects and assess possible biases in having multiple short-duration deployments (inflating N, using a limited number of tags) and (2) to evaluate potential effects of two different instrument combinations (SMRU satellite data relay loggers and very high frequency radio transmitters versus Wildlife Computers time–depth recorders and very high frequency radio transmitters) on trip durations, dive parameters, female body condition and pup growth. Handling did not appear to have any effects on the parameters studied; data from the first and second trips did not differ significantly. This implies that multiple short-term deployments are unlikely to result in biased data in this species. Instrument type did have measurable effects; time-at-sea was greater and pup growth was lower for pairs in which mothers carried bulkier instruments. This suggests that instrument streamlining is important to avoid negative impacts and that bulkier equipment should be deployed on lactating females with caution and only for short periods. The study highlights that instrument effects should be taken into account when comparing data from experiments collected using different equipment packages.

abstract = {When facing environmental change and intensified anthropogenic impact on marine ecosystems, extensive knowledge of how these systems are functioning is required in order to manage them properly. However, in high-latitude ecosystems, where climate change is expected to have substantial ecological impact, the ecosystem functions of biological species have received little attention, partly due to the limited biological knowledge of Arctic species. Functional traits address the ecosystem functions of member species, allowing the functionality of communities to be characterised and the degree of functional redundancy to be assessed. Ecosystems with higher functional redundancy are expected to be less affected by species loss, and therefore less sensitive to disturbance. Here we highlight and compare typical functional characteristics of Arctic and boreal fish in the Barents Sea and address the consequences of a community-wide reorganization driven by climate warming on functional redundancy and characterization. Based on trait and fish community composition data, we assessed functional redundancy of the Barents Sea fish community for the period 2004–2012, a period during which this northern region was characterized by rapidly warming water masses and declining sea ice coverage. We identified six functional groups, with distinct spatial distributions, that collectively provide a functional characterization of Barents Sea fish. The functional groups displayed different prevalence in boreal and Arctic water masses. Some functional groups displayed a spatial expansion towards the northeast during the study period, whereas other groups showed a general decline in functional redundancy. Presently, the observed patterns of functional redundancy would seem to provide sufficient scope for buffering against local loss in functional diversity only for the more speciose functional groups. Furthermore, the observed functional reconfiguration may affect future ecosystem functioning in the area. In a period of rapid environmental change, monitoring programs integrating functional traits will help inform management on ecosystem functioning and vulnerability.},

abstract = {Aim Accurate predictions of cetacean distributions are essential to their conservation but are limited by statistical challenges and a paucity of data. This study aimed at comparing the capacity of various statistical algorithms to deal with biases commonly found in nonsystematic cetacean surveys and to evaluate the potential for citizen science data to improve habitat modelling and predictions. An endangered population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their breeding ground was used as a case study. Location New Caledonia, Oceania. Methods Five statistical algorithms were used to model the habitat preferences of humpback whales from 1,360 sightings collected over 14 years of nonsystematic research surveys. Three different background sampling approaches were tested when developing models from 625 crowdsourced sightings to assess methods accounting for citizen science spatial sampling bias. Model evaluation was conducted through cross‐validation and prediction to an independent satellite tracking dataset. Results Algorithms differed in complexity of the environmental relationships modelled, ecological interpretability and transferability. While parameter tuning had a great effect on model performances, GLMs generally had low predictive performance, SVMs were particularly hard to interpret, and BRTs had high descriptive power but showed signs of overfitting. MAXENT and especially GAMs provided a valuable complexity trade‐off, accurate predictions and were ecologically intelligible. Models showed that humpback whales favoured cool (22–23°C) and shallow waters (0–100 m deep) in coastal as well as offshore areas. Citizen science models converged with research survey models, specifically when accounting for spatial sampling bias. Main conclusions Marine megafauna distribution models present specific challenges that may be addressed through integrative evaluation, independent testing and appropriately tuned statistical algorithms. Specifically, controlling overfitting is a priority when predicting cetacean distributions for large‐scale conservation perspectives. Citizen science data appear to be a powerful tool to describe cetacean habitat.},

abstract = {The past was a world of giants, with abundant whales in the sea and large animals roaming the land. However, that world came to an end following massive late-Quaternary megafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in great whale populations over the past few centuries. These losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling, because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. We estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8% of the preextinction value on land and about 5% of historic values in oceans. For phosphorus (P), a key nutrient, upward movement in the ocean by marine mammals is about 23% of its former capacity (previously about 340 million kg of P per year). Movements by seabirds and anadromous fish provide important transfer of nutrients from the sea to land, totalling ∼150 million kg of P per year globally in the past, a transfer that has declined to less than 4% of this value as a result of the decimation of seabird colonies and anadromous fish populations. We propose that in the past, marine mammals, seabirds, anadromous fish, and terrestrial animals likely formed an interlinked system recycling nutrients from the ocean depths to the continental interiors, with marine mammals moving nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters, seabirds and anadromous fish moving nutrients from the ocean to land, and large animals moving nutrients away from hotspots into the continental interior.},

abstract = {The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: Mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.},

abstract = {1-Energy expenditure is an important component of foraging ecology, but is extremely difficult to estimate in free-ranging animals and depends on how animals partition their time between different activities during foraging. Acceleration data has emerged as a new way to determine energy expenditure at a fine scale but needs to be tested and validated in wild animals. 2-This study investigated whether vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) could accurately predict the energy expended by marine predators during a full foraging trip. We also aimed to determine whether the accuracy of predictions of energy expenditure derived from acceleration increased when partitioned by different types of at-sea activities (i.e., diving, transiting, resting and surface activities) vs calculated activity-specific metabolic rates. 3-To do so, we equipped 20 lactating northern (Callorhinus ursinus) and 20 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with GPS, time-depth recorders and tri-axial accelerometers, and obtained estimates of field metabolic rates using the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method. VeDBA was derived from tri-axial acceleration, and at-sea activities (diving, transiting, resting and surface activities) were determined using dive depth, tri-axial acceleration and traveling speed. 4-We found that VeDBA did not accurately predict the total energy expended by fur seals during their full foraging trips (R2 = 0.36). However, the accuracy of VeDBA as a predictor of total energy expenditure increased significantly when foraging trips were partitioned by activity and used activity-specific VeDBA paired with time activity budgets (R2 = 0.70). Activity-specific VeDBA also accurately predicted the energy expenditures of each activity independent of each other (R2 > 0.85). 5-Our study confirms that acceleration is a promising way to estimate energy expenditures of free-ranging marine mammals at a fine scale never attained before. However, it shows that it needs to be based on the time-activity budget that make up foraging trips rather than being derived as a single measure of VeDBA applied to entire foraging trips. Our activity-based method provides a cost-effective means to accurately calculate energy expenditures of fur seals using acceleration and time-activity budgets, a stepping stone for numerous other research fields.

abstract = {Low catch limits for forage species are often considered to be precautionary measures that can help conserve marine predators. Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators. Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins. Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates of krill were ≥0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77. Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass may not be precautionary for their predators.},

abstract = {A population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) spends the austral summer feeding on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). These whales acquire their annual energetic needs during an episodic feeding season in high latitude waters that must sustain long-distance migration and fasting on low-latitude breeding grounds. Antarctic krill are broadly distributed along the continental shelf and nearshore waters during the spring and early summer, and move closer to land during late summer and fall, where they overwinter under the protective and nutritional cover of sea ice. We apply a novel space-time utilization distribution method to test the hypothesis that humpback whale distribution reflects that of krill: spread broadly during summer with increasing proximity to shore and associated embayments during fall.},

abstract = {The full magnitude and complexity of bird migration have not been possible to grasp until after the revolutionary discoveries made with the aid of, e.g., ringing, systematic field observations and radar. These have opened up opportunities for a more formalized theoretical construction work during the recent decades. The introduction of theoretical concepts and tools from flight mechanics into the field of bird flight and migration took place during the 1960s and 1970s and paved the way for the use of optimization analysis to evaluate adaptive aspects of flight behaviour, fuel deposition and responses to wind drift by migrating birds. The approach has been expanded, i.e. through the use of stochastic dynamic programming, to analyse the expected disposition of the migratory journey (with respect to Eight and stopover arrangement) under different ecological conditions and the adaptive temporal structure of the annual cycle of a migratory bird. Theoretical considerations also play an important role in analysing the orientation of migratory birds, their population ecology, and patterns of differential migration. Theoretical developments in these areas are reviewed. In the long run evolutionary and mechanistic theories must meet and join to provide a full understanding. While optimization models standing up to critical tests may help to identify primary forces of balancing selection and constraints, mechanistic theories are needed to tell us how the inherent biological algorithms operate within the sensory, neural and physiological systems to control behaviour and design in an adaptive way.},

abstract = {Knowledge about swarm dynamics and underlying causes is essential to understand the ecology and distribution of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We collected acoustic data and key environmental data continuously across extensive gradients in the little-studied Southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. A total of 4791 krill swarms with swarm descriptors including swarm height and length, packing density, swimming depth and inter-swarm distance were extracted. Through multivariate statistics, swarms were categorized into 4 groups. Group 2 swarms were largest (median length 108 m and thickness 18 m), whereas swarms in both Groups 1 and 4 were on average small, but differed markedly in depth distribution (median: 52 m for Group 1 vs. 133 m for Group 4). There was a strong spatial autocorrelation in the occurrence of swarms, and an autologistic regression model found no prediction of swarm occurrence from environmental variables for any of the Groups 1, 2 or 4. Probability of occurrence of Group 3 swarms, however, increased with increasing depth and temperature. Group 3 was the most distinctive swarm group with an order of magnitude higher packing density (median: 226 ind. m-3) than swarms from any of the other groups and about twice the distance to nearest neighbor swarm (median: 493 m). The majority of the krill were present in Group 3 swarms, and the absence of association with hydrographic or topographic concentrating mechanisms strongly suggests that these swarms aggregate through their own locomotion, possibly associated with migration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Climate change may strongly influence species distribution and, thus, the structure and function of ecosystems. This paper describes simulated changes in the position of the upper treeline in the Swedish mountains in response to predicted climate change. Data on predicted summer temperature changes, the current position of the treeline, and a digital elevation model were used to predict the position of the treeline over a 100-year timeframe. The results show the treeline advancing upward by 233-667 m, depending on the climate scenario used and location within the mountain chain. Such changes hypothetically caused a 75-85% reduction in treeless alpine heaths, with 60-93% of the remaining areas being scree slopes and boulder fields. For this change to occur, the migration rate of the trees would be in the order of 23-221 m yr(-1), which is well within published migration rates for wind-dispersed deciduous trees. The remaining alpine areas would be strongly fragmented. These drastic changes would influence all aspects of mountain ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and human land-use patterns.},

abstract = {Background: Tree encroachment of arctic tundra and alpine vegetation is a generally predicted response to climate warming. However, herbivory plays an important role in structuring these ecosystems and their responses to warming. Aims: To experimentally test how grazing and increased growing season temperature influence growth, physiognomy and stature of birch in the alpine zone. Methods: Trait responses of naturally regenerated birch saplings to warming (open-top chambers), and changed grazing regime (exclosures) were compared with those growing in unmanipulated conditions over a 10-year period (1999-2008). The effect of treatment over time and differences between treatments were analysed with repeated measures GLM (Generalised Linear Model) and simple contrasts in GLM. Results: Warming alone had no major effect on trait responses, however, significantly smaller leaves and an increased number of short shoots indicated warming-related growth constraints. Grazing showed a strong controlling effect on most traits, conserving low stature sapling stage characterised by fewer shoots and larger leaves, compared with non-grazed treatments. Conclusions: Although derived from one experimental site, the results point to a grazing-controlled response to environmental change, with climate (warming) as a secondary driver. This herbivore-driven masking of expected climate-driven tree expansion emphasises the necessity to consider changes in grazing regimes along with climate change, in order to avoid misleading interpretations regarding climate-driven tundra encroachment.},

abstract = {The underwater hearing sensitivity of a two-year-old harbor porpoise was measured in a pool using standard psycho-acoustic techniques. The go/no-go response paradigm and up-down staircase psychometric method were used. Auditory sensitivity was measured by using narrow-band frequency-modulated signals having center frequencies between 250 Hz and 180 kHz. The resulting audiogram was U-shaped with the range of best hearing (defined as 10 dB within maximum sensitivity) from 16 to 140 kHz, with a reduced sensitivity around 64 kHz. Maximum sensitivity (about 33 dB re 1 microPa) occurred between 100 and 140 kHz. This maximum sensitivity range corresponds with the peak frequency of echolocation pulses produced by harbor porpoises (120-130 kHz). Sensitivity falls about 10 dB per octave below 16 kHz and falls off sharply above 140 kHz (260 dB per octave). Compared to a previous audiogram of this species (Andersen, 1970), the present audiogram shows less sensitive hearing between 2 and 8 kHz and more sensitive hearing between 16 and 180 kHz. This harbor porpoise has the highest upper-frequency limit of all odontocetes investigated. The time it took for the porpoise to move its head 22 cm after the signal onset (movement time) was also measured. It increased from about 1 s at 10 dB above threshold, to about 1.5 s at threshold.},

abstract = {The introduction of animal-borne, multisensor tags has opened up many opportunities for ecological research, making previously inaccessible species and behaviors observable. The advancement of tag technology and the increasingly widespread use of bio-logging tags are leading to large volumes of sometimes extremely detailed data. With the increasing quantity and duration of tag deployments, a set of tools needs to be developed to aid in facilitating and standardizing the analysis of movement sensor data. Here, we developed an observation-based decision tree method to detect feeding events in data from multisensor movement tags attached to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Fin whales exhibit an energetically costly and kinematically complex foraging behavior called lunge feeding, an intermittent ram filtration mechanism. Using this automated system, we identified feeding lunges in 19 fin whales tagged with multisensor tags, during a total of over 100 h of continuously sampled data. Using movement sensor and hydrophone data, the automated lunge detector correctly identified an average of 92.8% of all lunges, with a false-positive rate of 9.5%. The strong performance of our automated feeding detector demonstrates an effective, straightforward method of activity identification in animal-borne movement tag data. Our method employs a detection algorithm that utilizes a hierarchy of simple thresholds based on knowledge of observed features of feeding behavior, a technique that is readily modifiable to fit a variety of species and behaviors. Using automated methods to detect behavioral events in tag records will significantly decrease data analysis time and aid in standardizing analysis methods, crucial objectives with the rapidly increasing quantity and variety of on-animal tag data. Furthermore, our results have implications for next-generation tag design, especially long-term tags that can be outfitted with on-board processing algorithms that automatically detect kinematic events and transmit ethograms via acoustic or satellite telemetry.},

abstract = {Applications of logistic regression in a used-unused design in wildlife habitat studies often suffer from asymmetry of errors: used resource units (landscape locations) are known with certainty, whereas unused resource units might be observed to be used with greater sampling intensity. More appropriate might be to use logistic regression to estimate a resource selection function (RSF) tied to a use-availability design based on independent samples drawn from used and available resource units. We review the theoretical motivation for RSFs and show that sample "contamination" and the exponential form commonly assumed for the RSF are not concerns, contrary to recent statements by Keating and Cherry (2004; Use and interpretation of logistic regression in habitat-selection studies. Journal of Wildlife Management 68:774-789). To do this, we re-derive the use-availability likelihood and show that it can be maximized by logistic regression software. We then consider 2 case studies that illustrate our findings. For our first case study, we fit both RSFs and resource selection probability functions (RSPF) to point count data for 4 bird species with varying levels of occurrence among sample blocks. Drawing on our new derivation of the likelihood, we sample available resource units with replacement and assume overlapping distributions of used and available resource units. Irrespective of overlap, we observed approximate proportionality between predictions of a RSF and RSPF. For our second case study, we evaluate the classic use-availability design suggested by Manly et al. (2002), where availability is sampled without replacement, and we systematically introduce contamination to a sample of available units applied to RSFs for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Although contamination appeared to reduce the magnitude of one RSF beta coefficient, change in magnitude exceeded sampling variation only when > 20% of the available units were confirmed caribou use locations (i.e., contaminated). These empirically based simulations suggest that previously recommended sampling designs are robust to contamination. We conclude with a new validation method for evaluating predictive performance of a RSF and for assessing if the model deviates from being proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit.},

abstract = {Harp seals require pack ice as a platform for resting, to give birth and nurse their young. They are also subject to commercial and subsistence harvesting. In the late 1990's there were concerns that the Northwest Atlantic population would decline to very low levels unless a management system using Potential Biological Removals (PBR) was adopted. Canada followed a different approach and high harvests based on an alternative management framework continued throughout the next decade. We examined the status of the Northwest Atlantic harp seal population using a three parameter population model that incorporates information on reproductive rates, removals, and ice-related mortality acting on young of the year. By 1971, the population had declined to a minimum of 1.1 million animals and a quota was introduced, which allowed the population to increase. In 1996, the quota was raised and harvests increased substantially. Population growth continued, even as herd productivity declined. The population reached a maximum of 7.8 million animals in 2008 and has leveled off at around 7.4 million animals. Climate change is expected to result in a decline in the amount of seasonal pack ice in Atlantic Canada, which adds uncertainty to the future of this population. Although the results presented in this paper focused on how the status of this population has evolved over the last 60. years, our integrated modeling approach can also be used to examine scenarios that project into the future, to test the impacts of various management decisions in a changing environment.},

abstract = {In southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), fasting- and foragingrelated fluctuations in body composition are reflected by buoyancy changes. Such buoyancy changes can be monitored by measuring changes in the rate at which a seal drifts passively through the water column, i.e. when all active swimming motion ceases. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based method for detecting buoyancy changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. By step-wise filtering of the dive data, the developed algorithm identifies fragments of dives that correspond to times when animals drift. In the dive records of 11 southern elephant seals from South Georgia, this filtering method identified 0.8-2.2% of all dives as drift dives, indicating large individual variation in drift diving behaviour. The obtained drift rate time series exhibit that, at the beginning of each migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75-150 days, the buoyancy of all individuals peaked close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal's foraging success. Independent verification with visually inspected detailed high-resolution dive data confirmed that this method is capable of reliably detecting buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted data. This also affirms that abstracted dive profiles convey the geometric shape of drift dives in sufficient detail for them to be identified. Further, it suggests that, using this step-wise filtering method, buoyancy changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.},

abstract = {The duration of breath-hold dives and the available time for foraging in submerged prey patches is ultimately constrained by oxygen balance. There is a close relationship between swim speed and oxygen utilisation, so it is likely that breath-holding divers optimise their speeds to and from the feeding patch to maximise time spent feeding at depth. Optimal foraging models suggest that transit swim speed should decrease to minimum cost of transport (MCT) speed in deeper and longer duration dives. Observations also suggest that descent and ascent swimming mode and speed may vary in response to changes in buoyancy. We measured the swimming behaviour during simulated foraging of seven captive female grey seals ( two adults and five pups). Seals had to swim horizontally underwater from a breathing box to a submerged automatic feeder. The distance to the feeder and the rate of prey food delivery could be varied to simulate different feeding conditions. Diving durations and distances travelled in dives recorded during these experiments were similar to those recorded in the wild. Mean swim speed decreased significantly with increasing distance to the patch, indicating that seals adjusted their speed in response to travel distance, consistent with optimality model predictions. There was, however, no significant relationship between the transit swim speeds and prey density at the patch. Interestingly, all seals swam 10-20% faster on their way to the prey patch compared to the return to the breathing box, despite the fact that any effect of buoyancy on swimming speed should be the same in both directions. These results suggest that the swimming behaviour exhibited by foraging grey seals might be a combination of having to overcome the forces of buoyancy during vertical swimming and also of behavioural choices made by the seals.},

abstract = {The development of the mechanical and aerodynamical theory of bird flight has greatly stimulated research at widely different levels in the field of bird movement.  Recent work has shown that the drag of bird bodies is less than was previously assumed.  Furthermore, the structure and circulation of wingtip vortices in the wake of flying birds have been revealed, with implications for estimating flight performance on the basis of vortex theory.  Predictions about optimal speed and flight behaviour have been successfully tested by field studies using optical and radar registration.  Flight theory also allows predictions about optimal fuel deposition rules for migrating birds.  Research about bird flight, with the dynamic interplay between theoretical development and empirical work in biophysics, physiology and ecology, represents a fine example of a highly successful use of the optimality approach in biology.},

abstract = {The iron-limited Southern Ocean plays an important role in regulating atmospheric CO(2) levels. Marine mammal respiration has been proposed to decrease the efficiency of the Southern Ocean biological pump by returning photosynthetically fixed carbon to the atmosphere. Here, we show that by consuming prey at depth and defecating iron-rich liquid faeces into the photic zone, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) instead stimulate new primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean. We estimate that Southern Ocean sperm whales defecate 50 tonnes of iron into the photic zone each year. Molar ratios of C(export):Fe(added) determined during natural ocean fertilization events are used to estimate the amount of carbon exported to the deep ocean in response to the iron defecated by sperm whales. We find that Southern Ocean sperm whales stimulate the export of 4 × 10(5) tonnes of carbon per year to the deep ocean and respire only 2 × 10(5) tonnes of carbon per year. By enhancing new primary production, the populations of 12 000 sperm whales in the Southern Ocean act as a carbon sink, removing 2 × 10(5) tonnes more carbon from the atmosphere than they add during respiration. The ability of the Southern Ocean to act as a carbon sink may have been diminished by large-scale removal of sperm whales during industrial whaling.},

abstract = {The recent increase in data accuracy from high resolution accelerometers offers substantial potential for improved understanding and prediction of animal movements. However, current approaches used for analysing these multivariable datasets typically require existing knowledge of the behaviors of the animals to inform the behavioral classification process. These methods are thus not well-suited for the many cases where limited knowledge of the different behaviors performed exist. Here, we introduce the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm. To illustrate the method's capability we analyse data collected using a combination of GPS and Accelerometers on two seabird species: razorbills (Alca torda) and common guillemots (Uria aalge). We applied the unsupervised learning algorithm Expectation Maximization to characterize latent behavioral states both above and below water at both individual and group level. The application of this flexible approach yielded significant new insights into the foraging strategies of the two study species, both above and below the surface of the water. In addition to general behavioral modes such as flying, floating, as well as descending and ascending phases within the water column, this approach allowed an exploration of previously unstudied and important behaviors such as searching and prey chasing/capture events. We propose that this unsupervised learning approach provides an ideal tool for the systematic analysis of such complex multivariable movement data that are increasingly being obtained with accelerometer tags across species. In particular, we recommend its application in cases where we have limited current knowledge of the behaviors performed and existing supervised learning approaches may have limited utility.},

abstract = {Age is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology, but is difficult to determine in many species. Humpback whales exemplify this as they have a lifespan comparable to humans, mature sexually as early as 4 years and have no reliable visual age indicators after their first year. Current methods for estimating humpback age cannot be applied to all individuals and populations. Assays for human age have recently been developed based on age-induced changes in DNA methylation of specific genes. We used information on age-associated DNA methylation in human and mouse genes to identify homologous gene regions in humpbacks. Humpback skin samples were obtained from individuals with a known year of birth and employed to calibrate relationships between cytosine methylation and age. Seven of 37 cytosines assayed for methylation level in humpback skin had significant age-related profiles. The three most age-informative cytosine markers were selected for a humpback epigenetic age assay. The assay has an R(2) of 0.787 (P = 3.04e-16) and predicts age from skin samples with a standard deviation of 2.991 years. The epigenetic method correctly determined which of parent-offspring pairs is the parent in more than 93% of cases. To demonstrate the potential of this technique, we constructed the first modern age profile of humpback whales off eastern Australia and compared the results to population structure 5 decades earlier. This is the first epigenetic age estimation method for a wild animal species and the approach we took for developing it can be applied to many other nonmodel organisms.},

abstract = {As part of global efforts to reduce dependence on carbon-based energy sources there has been a rapid increase in the installation of renewable energy devices. The installation and operation of these devices can result in conflicts with wildlife. In the marine environment, mammals may avoid wind farms that are under construction or operating. Such avoidance may lead to more time spent travelling or displacement from key habitats. A paucity of data on at-sea movements of marine mammals around wind farms limits our understanding of the nature of their potential impacts. Here, we present the results of a telemetry study on harbour seals Phoca vitulina in The Wash, south-east England, an area where wind farms are being constructed using impact pile driving. We investigated whether seals avoid wind farms during operation, construction in its entirety, or during piling activity. The study was carried out using historical telemetry data collected prior to any wind farm development and telemetry data collected in 2012 during the construction of one wind farm and the operation of another. Within an operational wind farm, there was a close-to-significant increase in seal usage compared to prior to wind farm development. However, the wind farm was at the edge of a large area of increased usage, so the presence of the wind farm was unlikely to be the cause. There was no significant displacement during construction as a whole. However, during piling, seal usage (abundance) was significantly reduced up to 25 km from the piling activity; within 25 km of the centre of the wind farm, there was a 19 to 83% (95% confidence intervals) decrease in usage compared to during breaks in piling, equating to a mean estimated displacement of 440 individuals. This amounts to significant displacement starting from predicted received levels of between 166 and 178 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa(p-p). Displacement was limited to piling activity; within 2 h of cessation of pile driving, seals were distributed as per the non-piling scenario. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial and temporal quantification of avoidance of wind farms by harbour seals is critical to reduce uncertainty and increase robustness in environmental impact assessments of future developments. Specifically, the results will allow policymakers to produce industry guidance on the likelihood of displacement of seals in response to pile driving; the relationship between sound levels and avoidance rates; and the duration of any avoidance, thus allowing far more accurate environmental assessments to be carried out during the consenting process. Further, our results can be used to inform mitigation strategies in terms of both the sound levels likely to cause displacement and what temporal patterns of piling would minimize the magnitude of the energetic impacts of displacement.},

As a result, the Southern Ocean strongly influences climate patterns and the cycling of carbon and nutrients. Changes in the Southern Ocean would therefore have global ramifications. Limited observations suggest the Southern Ocean is indeed changing: the region is warming more rapidly than the global ocean average; salinity changes driven by changes in precipitation and ice melt have been observed in both the upper and abyssal ocean; the uptake of carbon by the Southern Ocean has slowed the rate of climate change but increased the acidity of the ocean; and Southern Ocean ecosystems are reacting to changes in the physical and chemical environment. However, the short and incomplete nature of existing time series makes the causes and consequences of observed changes difficult to assess. Sustained, multidisciplinary observations are required to detect, interpret and respond to change.},

abstract = {During their long migrations through the Pacific, northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, never haul out on land and they rarely spend more than a few minutes at a time at the surface. They are almost constantly making repetitive, deep dives, raising the question of when do they rest? One type of dive, the drift dive, characterized by a time-depth profile with a phase of lower than average descent speed is believed to be a resting dive. To examine the behaviour of seals during drift dives, we measured body position and three-dimensional diving paths of six juvenile seals. We found that seals rolled over and sank on their backs during the drift phase, wobbling periodically so that they resembled a falling leaf. This enabled seals to drastically slow their descent rate, possibly so that negatively buoyant seals can rest without ending up in the abyss. This reduces the work required to return to the surface to breath, and allows them time to rest, process food or possibly sleep during the descent phase of these dives where they are probably less susceptible to predation. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae have adopted unique feeding strategies to take advantage of behavioral changes in their prey. However, logistical constraints have largely limited ecological analyses of these interactions. Our objectives were to (1) link humpback whale feeding behaviors to concurrent measurements of prey using scientific echo-sounders, and (2) quantify how sand lance behavior influences the feeding behaviors and foraging ecology of humpback whales. To measure, in fine detail, the 3-dimensional orientation and movement patterns of humpback whales underwater, we used a multi-sensor tag attached via suction cups (DTAG). We tested the specific hypothesis that the diel movement patterns of sand lance between bottom substrate and the water column correlates to changes between surface and bottom feeding strategies of humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, MA. We collected over 96 h of both day- and nighttime data from 15 whales in 2006, and recorded 393 surface and 230 bottom feeding events. Individual whales exhibit both surface and bottom feeding behaviors, switching from one to the other in relation to changing light and prey conditions. Surface feeding behaviors were individually variable in their constitution but ubiquitously biased towards daylight hours, when prey was most abundant in the upper portion of the water column. Bottom feeding behavior occurred largely at night, coincident with when sand lance descend to seek refuge in the substrate. Our data provide novel insights into the behavioral ecology of humpback whales and their prey, indicating significant diel patterns in foraging behaviors concurrent with changes in prey behavior.},

Newfoundland (47$^\circ$ $9'$ N. 55$^\circ$ $25'$ W), were made to obtain estimates of volume and surface area of the animal. Detailed measurements of the flukes, both planform and sections, were also obtained. A strip theory was developed to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of the whale's flukes as an oscillating propeller. This method is based on linear, two-dimensional, small-amplitude, unsteady hydrofoil theory with correction factors used to acount for the effects of finite span and finite amplitude motion. These correction factors were developed from theoretical results of large-amplitude heaving motion and unsteady lifting-surface theory. A model that makes an estimate of the effects of viscous flow on propeller performance was superimposed on the potential-flow results. This model estimates the drag of the hydrofoil sections by assuming that the drag is similar to that of a hydrofoil section in steady flow. The performance characteristics of the flukes of the fin whale were estimated by using this method. The effects of the different correction factors, and of the frictional drag of the fluke sections, are emphasized. Frictional effects in particular were found to reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency of the flukes significantly. The results are discussed and compared with the known characteristics of fin-whale swimming.},

abstract = {The diving behavior of a medium-sized female sperm whale off the Kumano Coast, Japan, was studied using a suction-cup-attached TDR (time depth recorder) tag. The tag remained attached to the whale for 62 h and recorded 74 dives deeper than 100 m. The whale repeatedly dived for 30 to 45 min down to 400–1200 m. Surface intervals were gener- ally 10 min between dives, except for a period of 1.3 to 4.2 h spent at the surface every afternoon. The whale spent long periods of time at the bottom of dives, during which there was considerable variability in both depth and velocity data, with occasional bursts in velocity. These data suggest that sperm whales use an active search-and-pursue strategy while forag- ing. Assuming all dives with active bottom time were for for- aging, this whale spent about 80% of its total time in foraging dives. Dives with little activity at depth were occasionally observed, which were probably for resting. Although dive parameters resemble those of northern bottlenose whales, dive profiles seem to be different, suggesting that these 2 deep diving cetaceans employ different foraging strategies.},

We investigated apparent lateralized behaviour in North Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the southern Gulf of Maine using digital acoustic tag ('DTAG') technology to analyse feeding behaviours during 2004-2009. An ideal tool to examine lateralized behaviours, DTAGs allowed continuous measurements of whale depth, heading, pitch and roll throughout the attachment period (less than 24 h). Side preference (right or left) in rolling behaviours (e.g. bottom rolling and side lunging) and directional preference (clockwise or anticlockwise) in feeding behaviours such as looping and spiraling were determined from visual examination of DTAG data. A 'handedness index' (HI) was used to quantify side bias and strength of preference. We found a population-level right-side bias similar to the 90/10 right-hand bias in humans. Furthermore, photos of jaw scuffing and direct tag data on rolling behaviour were used to assign a bottom-rolling side preference for 11 individuals for whom both of these data were available, 10 (90.9%) of which demonstrated a right-side bias. Consistent laterality was observed between individuals that performed bottom rolling and directional feeding behaviours, which was biased in the right/clockwise direction. Younger individuals tended to show weaker lateralization scores than older individuals, even among adults (P= 0.048), suggesting that lateralization develops, and continues to do so, beyond sexual maturity. ?? 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding by rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) is associated with a high energetic cost that decreases diving capacity, thereby limiting access to dense prey patches at depth. Despite this cost, rorquals exhibit high rates of lipid deposition and extremely large maximum body size. To address this paradox, we integrated kinematic data from digital tags with unsteady hydrodynamic models to estimate the energy budget for lunges and foraging dives of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest rorqual and living mammal. Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales. These results highlight the importance of high prey density, regardless of prey patch depth, for efficient bulk filter feeding in baleen whales and may explain some diel changes in foraging behavior in rorqual whales.},

abstract = {During foraging dives, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) produce long series of regular clicks at 0.5-2 s intervals interspersed with rapid-click buzzes called "creaks". Sound, depth and orientation recording Dtags were attached to 23 whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico to test whether the behaviour of diving sperm whales supports the hypothesis that creaks are produced during prey capture. Sperm whales spent most of their bottom time within one or two depth bands, apparently feeding in vertically stratified prey layers. Creak rates were highest during the bottom phase: 99.8% of creaks were produced in the deepest 50% of dives, 57% in the deepest 15% of dives. Whales swam actively during the bottom phase, producing a mean of 12.5 depth inflections per dive. A mean of 32% of creaks produced during the bottom phase occurred within 10 s of an inflection (13x more than chance). Sperm whales actively altered their body orientation throughout the bottom phase with significantly increased rates of change during creaks, reflecting increased manoeuvring. Sperm whales increased their bottom foraging time when creak rates were higher. These results all strongly support the hypothesis that creaks are an echolocation signal adapted for foraging, analogous to terminal buzzes in taxonomically diverse echolocating species.},

abstract = {Gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are highly disruptive bottom feeders that remove infaunal invertebrate prey and sediments by suction. The response of the benthos to gray whale feeding was examined in the primary feeding grounds of the Bering Sea and in an ecological analog of these prey communities along the west coast of Vancouver Island. Prey communities were dominated by ampeliscid and other amphipod crustaceans that formed dense tube mats. Large feeding excavations (often 2-20 m^2) were rapidly colonized by scavenging lysianassid amphipods, especially Anonyx spp., that attacked injured and dislodged infauna. Many of the attacked animals were small crustaceans (<1 cm long) and polychaete worms. Anonyx xpp. was 20-30 times more abundant inside fresh excavations than in the surrounding tube mat, where they dispersed within hours after the initial feeding disturbance. A smaller species of lysianassid, Orchomene minuta, invades less rapidly and remained much longer in excavations than the larger, Anonyx spp. Natural scavenging events outside feeding excavations revealed that lysianassids commonly fed on relatively small crustacean carcasses (<3 cm long). Within days and weeks, gray whale feeding excavations trapped organic debris. Most invading species were much more abundant in debris patches compared to debris-free areas of the same excavations. The numbers of some colonists remained elevated in disturbed areas for >2 mo. Early colonists were characterized by much greater abundances inside excavations relative to the adjacent tube mat. Two numerically dominant groups of tube-dwelling amphipods were not characterized by a large pulse of abundance inside excavations. Ampelisca and Protomedeia gradually colonized pits. They also swam less frequently than the early colonists, and probably had more infaunal habits. Gray whale feeding clearly has a dramatic impact on the structure of benthic communities, and also may enhance the population size of several secondary prey.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain and predict the behaviour of air-breathing divers exploiting a food resource underwater. Many field observations of the behaviour of divers do not fit with the prediction that to maximize energetic gain divers should dive close to their aerobic diving limits. In an attempt to explain this paradox, Thompson & Fedak (2001, Animal Behaviour, 61, 286–297) proposed a model of diving behaviour that takes into account patchily distributed prey patches of varying quality. We tested this model experimentally in a simulated foraging set-up. We measured the diving behaviour of grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, diving to patches of varying prey density and distance from the surface. Our results were equivocal with respect to the model predictions. Seals responded to prey density, leaving low-quality patches earlier. However, this pattern was still evident at long dive distances, contrary to the prediction that during deep dives seals should stay at a patch regardless of prey density. While seals maximized dive durations at high prey densities and long distances, they did not do so at short distances. The apparent quitting strategy of the seals always produced higher net rates of energy gain than would have been achieved if they had remained at the foraging site up to their aerobic dive limit on every dive. These results indicate that seals' diving behaviour, particularly bottom duration, may indicate the relative prey availability in their environment.},

abstract = {Despite their importance in determining the rate of both energy gain and expenditure; how the fine-scale kinematics of foraging are modified in response to changes in prey abundance and distribution remain poorly understood in many animal ecosystems. In the marine environment; bulk-filter feeders rely on dense aggregations of prey for energetically efficient foraging. Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) exhibit a unique form of filter feeding called lunge feeding; a process whereby discrete volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered. In many large rorqual species the size of engulfed water mass is commensurate with the whale's body size; yet is engulfed in just a few seconds. This filter-feeding mode thus requires precise coordination of the body and enlarged engulfment apparatus to maximize capture efficiency. Previous studies from whale-borne tags revealed that many rorqual species perform rolling behaviours when foraging. It has been hypothesized that such acrobatic manoeuvres may be required for efficient prey capture when prey manifest in small discrete patches; but to date there has been no comprehensive analysis of prey patch characteristics during lunge feeding events. We developed a null hypothesis that blue whale kinematics are independent of prey patch characteristics. To test this hypothesis; we investigated the foraging performance of blue whales; the largest filter-feeding predator and their functional response to variability in their sole prey source; krill using a generalized additive mixed model framework. We used a combination of animal-borne movement sensors and hydroacoustic prey mapping to simultaneously quantify the three-dimensional foraging kinematics of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the characteristics of targeted krill patches. Our analyses rejected our null hypothesis; showing that blue whales performed more acrobatic manoeuvres; including 180° and 360° rolling lunges; when foraging on low-density krill patches. In contrast; whales targeting high-density krill patches involved less manoeuvring during lunges and higher lunge feeding rates. These data demonstrate that blue whales exhibit a range of adaptive foraging strategies that maximize prey capture in different ecological contexts. Because first principles indicate that manoeuvres require more energy compared with straight trajectories; our data reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator–prey interactions that are not accounted for in optimal foraging and energetic efficiency models.},

abstract = {Flexibility in activity time budgets allows animals to cope with heterogeneous and changing environments. Many marine predators, such as seabirds, exhibit flexibility in their foraging behaviour to buffer reproductive success against periods of low prey availability. Over 3 years, 2004 to 2006, we studied the foraging behaviour of a threatened seabird, the marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus in southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. An information–theoretic approach was used to compare among factors (temporal, spatial, environmental, and competitors) that may influence diving activity. We also quantified local prey availability by hydroacoustic surveys and regional oceanographic conditions (chlorophyll a concentrations and upwelling indices) to investigate relationships between diving activity, food supply and environmental conditions. Prey indices varied spatially, seasonally, and annually, showing reduced prey availability during incubation and chick-rearing of 2005. Upwelling indices and chlorophyll a concentrations, as an index of primary productivity, were delayed in 2005. Year and breeding phase had the greatest impact on diving activity, with additional variation among sites. Murrelets increased diving activity in years and seasons with scarce prey and poor oceanographic conditions (incubation and chick-rearing 2005) and decreased diving activity at sites with high prey availability. There was a linear relationship between diving activity and food availability, suggesting no clear thresholds in response to decreases in prey. Despite their flexible activity budgets, increased foraging effort by murrelets in 2005 was inadequate to ensure average levels of reproductive success. Thus, flexible foraging behaviour by murrelets may be ineffective to buffer reproductive success when environmental conditions are extremely poor.},

@article{Potvin2010,
abstract = {Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) obtain their food by lunge feeding, a dynamic process that involves the intermittent engulfment and filtering of large amounts of water and prey. During a lunge, whales accelerate to high speed and open their mouth wide, thereby exposing a highly distensible buccal cavity to the flow and facilitating its inflation. Unsteady hydrodynamic models suggest that the muscles associated with the ventral groove blubber undergo eccentric contraction in order to stiffen and control the inflation of the buccal cavity; in doing so the engulfed water mass is accelerated forward as the whale's body slows down. Although the basic mechanics of lunge feeding are relatively well known, the scaling of this process remains poorly understood, particularly with regards to its duration (from mouth opening to closure). Here we formulate a new theory of engulfment time which integrates prey escape behavior with the mechanics of the whale's body, including lunge speed and acceleration, gape angle dynamics, and the controlled inflation of the buccal cavity. Given that the complex interaction between these factors must be highly coordinated in order to maximize engulfment volume, the proposed formulation rests on the scenario of Synchronized Engulfment, whereby the filling of the cavity (posterior to the temporomandibular joint) coincides with the moment of maximum gape. When formulated specifically for large rorquals feeding on krill, our analysis predicts that engulfment time increases with body size, but in amounts dictated by the specifics of krill escape and avoidance kinematics. The predictions generated by the model are corroborated by limited empirical data on a species-specific basis, particularly for humpback and blue whales chasing krill. A sensitivity analysis applied to all possible sized fin whales also suggests that engulfment duration and lunge speed will increase intra-specifically with body size under a wide range of predator-prey scenarios. This study provides the theoretical framework required to estimate the scaling of the mass-specific drag being generated during engulfment, as well as the energy expenditures incurred.},

abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a biologically rich area supporting large stand- ing stocks of krill and top predators (including whales, seals and seabirds). Physical forcing greatly af- fects productivity, recruitment, survival and distribution of krill in this area. In turn, such interactions are likely to affect the distribution of baleen whales. The Southern Ocean GLOBEC research program aims to explore the relationships and interactions between the environment, krill and predators around Marguerite Bay (WAP) in autumn 2001 and 2002. Bathymetric and environmental variables in- cluding acoustic backscattering as an indicator of prey abundance were used to model whale distrib- ution patterns. We used an iterative approach employing (1) classification and regression tree (CART) models to identify oceanographic and ecological variables contributing to variability in humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke Balaenoptera acutorstrata whale distribution, and (2) generalized additive models (GAMs) to elucidate functional ecological relationships between these variables and whale distribution. The CART models indicated that the cetacean distribution was tightly coupled with zooplankton acoustic volume backscatter in the upper (25 to 100 m), and middle (100 to 300 m) por- tions of the water column. Whale distribution was also related to distance from the ice edge and bathy- metric slope. The GAMs indicated a persistent, strong, positive relationship between increasing zoo- plankton volume and whale relative abundance. Furthermore, there was a lower limit for averaged acoustic volume backscatter of zooplankton below which the relationship between whales and prey was not significant. The GAMs also supported an annual relationship between whale distribution, distance from the ice edge and bathymetric slope, suggesting that these are important features for aggregating prey. Our results demonstrate that during the 2 yr study, whales were consistently and predictably associated with the distribution of zooplankton. Thus, humpback and minke whales may be able to locate physical features and oceanographic processes that enhance prey aggregation.},

Detection of the sounds from these elusive whales could reduce the risk of exposure, but descriptions of their vocalizations are at best incomplete. This paper reports quantitative characteristics of clicks from deep-diving Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) using a unique data set. Two whales in the Ligurian Sea were simultaneously tagged with sound and orientation recording tags, and the dive tracks were reconstructed allowing for derivation of the range and relative aspect between the clicking whales. At depth, the whales produced trains of regular echolocation clicks with mean interclick intervals of 0.43 s (±0.09) and 0.40 s (±0.07). The clicks are frequency modulated pulses with durations of ∼ 200 $\mu$s and center frequencies around 42 kHz, −10 dB bandwidths of 22 kHz, and Q3 dB of 4. The sound beam is narrow with an estimated directionality index of more than 25 dB, source levels up to 214 dBpp re: 1 $\mu$Pa at 1 m, and energy flux density of 164 dB re: 1 $\mu$Pa2 s. As the spectral and temporal properties are different from those of nonziphiid odontocetes the potential for passive detection is enhanced.},

@article{Goldbogen2012a,
abstract = {1. Diving capacity generally increases with body size both within and among taxanomic groups because of the differential scaling between body oxygen stores and metabolic rate. 2. Despite being some of the largest animals of all time, rorqual whales exhibit very short dive times relative to other large divers because of the high energetic costs incurred during lunge feeding. This mode of filter feeding requires high drag for the engulfment of large volumes of prey-laden water, and the magnitude of both drag and engulfment volume is largely determined by the size and shape of the skull. 3. The positive allometry of rorqual skulls increases mass-specific engulfment capacity in larger whales, but the energetic requirements of feeding are also predicted to increase and thus further limit diving capacity. 4. To test the hypothesis that the energetic cost of a lunge is disproportionately higher in larger rorquals, we compared diving and lunge-feeding performance among three different-sized species (blue, fin and humpback whales) foraging on krill. 5. Our hydrodynamic analyses indicate that the mass-specific energy expenditure will increase with body size if rorquals lunge at length-specific speeds (in body lengths per second) that are independent of body size, a condition that is supported by tag data. 6. Although the absolute time required to filter each volume of water increased with body size, maximum dive duration and depth were not significantly different among species. As a consequence, the maximum number of lunges executed per dive decreased with body size. 7. These data suggest that, unlike all other true divers, adult rorqual species do not exhibit a positive relationship between body size and diving capacity. Larger rorquals forfeit diving capacity for greater engulfment capacity, a trade-off that favours the efficient exploitation of patchily dense prey aggregations. Such a trade-off may underlie different foraging strategies associated with resource partitioning, life history and ecological niche.},

abstract = {Active hunting pursuit can involve high expenditures of energy and therefore requires appropriately high-energy gains from successful prey capture. Using data loggers deployed on 12 sperm whales off the Ogasawara Islands, we regularly recorded bursts of speed during deep dives. Here, we analyzed speed, acceleration, and 3D data from these maneuvers to describe the whales' hunting behavior. Bursts occurred at depths >400 m. The median number of bursts was only 1 per dive (range: 0 to 6 per dive), and 33% of the dives did not include any bursts, suggesting prey capture may not always require bursts. Bursts of speed averaged 3.4 ± 1.0 m s–1 (mean ± SD; maximum: 8 m s–1), more than twice the mean speed observed during dives (1.5 ± 0.2 m s–1). Bursts were generally divided into two phases: (1) rapid acceleration with active stroking, and (2) drastic deceleration and changes in body orientation. Tagged whales swam up to 405 m (mean: 120 ± 88 m) during these two phases. Such behavior suggests chasing of their prey, and should incur high energy expenditure. A large percentage (20 ± 14%) of the drag-related locomotion cost of the dives was spent in bursts. Two major types of bursts were observed: inflectional bursts with turning (87%) and linear bursts without turning (13%). Our results strongly indicate that sperm whales use an active-pursuit hunting strategy and use the bursts only to catch powerful and nutritious prey (i.e. large and/or muscular) that compensate for the energetic cost of the burst.},

abstract = {This study elucidated the internal mechanism that enables rorquals (Balaenopteridae) to engulf a large volume of water prior to filtering it for prey. Anatomic experiments and observations were made on specimens of Balaenoptera acutorostrata, B. borealis, and B. physalus to assess the dynamic relationships of the tongue, nonlingual intermandibular lining, and cavum ventrale (a tissue cleft beneath the grooved, ventral body wall) as they would occur during engulfment. With the mouth empty, a distinct, centrally furrowed tongue was present in all three species. The nonlingual intermandibular lining ran outwards from the root of the tongue to attach along the ventral border of the mandibles. The cavum ventrale extended anteriorly beneath the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining from the cervico-thoracic region. By simple manipulation, the tongue could be transformed into a hollow, sac-like structure invaginating the cervical portion of the cavum ventrale. During this transformation, the nonlingual intermandibular lining was stretched posteriorly to completely cover the floor of the mouth. When the mouth of a suspended B. acutorostrata specimen (head only) was filled with water to simulate engulfment the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining expanded through the transected space of the cavum ventrale to form a capacious "oral sac." The posteriodorsal wall of this sac was formed by what had been the tongue. Adaptations that enhance the expansibility of the oral sac include a highly elastic connective fiber matrix and a redundant surface created by epithelial corrugations and the tongue's central furrow. It is concluded that 1) during engulfment the tongue would initiate distension of the cavum ventrale by everting through the floor of the mouth between the cavum's inner and outer walls, 2) the everted, elastic tongue would act to enlarge the capacity of the mouth, and 3) the sac lining of the cavum ventrale at the end of engulfment would be created by the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining.},

abstract = {Humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, on Stellwagen Bank off eastern Massachusetts, U.S.A., apparently bottom feed on northern sand lance, Ammodytes dubius. The feeding behavior is characterized by the whales brushing the bottom in depths of less than 40 m, causing sand lance burrowed in the bottom to be flushed up into the water column. The greatest densities of sand lance were in beds of shells and shell debris, termed “shell hash.” The brushing against or along the bottom, particularly in these shell hash areas, caused the humpbacks to acquire abrasions and wounding, sometimes rather extensive, of the lateral lower jaw, and lateral and dorso-lateral upper jaw, here termed “jaw scuffing.” Scuffing of the dorsal fin and fluke edges was also common and may be at least partially related to this feeding behavior. Both mature and immature, and male and female, humpbacks exhibited jaw scuffing. The bottom-feeding behavior was not exclusive, as jaw-scuffed individuals were also observed to use other feeding behaviors. In recent years (1991-1993), however, bottom feeding appears to have become relatively more common, particularly among young animals. Overall, in the Stellwagen Bank area between 1979 and 1993, a majority of the population engaged in, or had engaged in, bottom feeding and the associated prey flushing.},

These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems. The next advance in aquatic telemetry will be the development of a global collaborative effort to facilitate infrastructure and data sharing and management over scales not previously possible.},

abstract = {We present the first acoustic observations of predator–prey interactions between fin whales and herring. The school dynamics and predation events of Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in a cold front area (about 125 km2) in the Norwegian Sea in April were quantified. Data from high-resolution sonar tracking of herring schools combined with echosounder data were integrated with pelagic-trawl samples. A total of 44 herring schools were each observed for an average of 34.8 min. Altogether, 184 behavioural events were recorded, with an event occurring every 8.3 min on average. Intra-school events (compression, reorganization, ring, pseudopodium, elongate, diving, surfacing) were observed every 15.3 min and inter-school events (approach, join, leave, split) every 22.9 min. We observed 17 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), six Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus) and five killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the experimental area. Predator events occurred every 91 min on average. Of these marine mammals only fin whales swimming alone or in small groups (2–5 ind.) were observed to attack herring. Attacks from fin whales were observed every 170 min. They strongly influenced the density, shape and structure of the herring schools. Large fish such as cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens) preying on herring in coastal areas were not caught in the pelagic trawl or detected by acoustics. Herring schools were on average large (987 m2), dense, swam at depth (148 m) and had a moderate swimming speed (1.1 body lengths per second), reflecting a risk-averse, anti-predator behaviour to marine mammals. We discuss differences in schooling dynamics, anti-predator behaviour, attack frequency and predation risk between herring attacked by fin whales in an offshore area and herring attacked by gadoid predators closer to the coast in a similar study in May.},

abstract = {Observations of non-feeding gulps in dwarf minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata sensu lato confirmed the axial rotation and lateral divergence (omega rotation) of the lower jaw suggested for rorquals. Gulps were either restricted to the inter-mandibular area or involved expansion of the whole ventral pouch; the extent of filling appears to be under voluntary control. Gulps may have different functions, e.g. feeding or display. Maximum gape (about 70{\textordmasculine}) occurred during inter-mandibular gulps, involving both depression of the lower jaw and elevation of the head and upper jaw. The lower jaw was depressed only to about 40{\textordmasculine}, much less than the 90{\textordmasculine} generally illustrated in the literature for rorquals. The mouth was closed as the ventral pouch was still filling; closure was rapid, associated with the moderate depression of the lower jaw. The whole ventral pouch contracted uniformly to expel water. The fibrocartilage skeleton of the ventral pouch was involved in outpocketing of the mental (“chin”) region both at the beginning and end of gulps. During expulsion of water, partial axial rotation of the lower jaw maintained a groove just lateral to the baleen plates, opening as a vertical slit posteriorly. This would allow water expelled between the baleen plates to flow backwards, especially from the angle of the mouth. Incorporating these new observations, we discuss evolution of filter feeding and suggest that suction feeding was the primitive condition for baleen whales.},

abstract = {Fin whales are among the largest predators on earth, yet little is known about their foraging behavior at depth. These whales obtain their prey by lunge-feeding, an extraordinary biomechanical event where large amounts of water and prey are engulfed and filtered. This process entails a high energetic cost that effectively decreases dive duration and increases post-dive recovery time. To examine the body mechanics of fin whales during foraging dives we attached high-resolution digital tags, equipped with a hydrophone, a depth gauge and a dual-axis accelerometer, to the backs of surfacing fin whales in the Southern California Bight. Body pitch and roll were estimated by changes in static gravitational acceleration detected by orthogonal axes of the accelerometer, while higher frequency, smaller amplitude oscillations in the accelerometer signals were interpreted as bouts of active fluking. Instantaneous velocity of the whale was determined from the magnitude of turbulent flow noise measured by the hydrophone and confirmed by kinematic analysis. Fin whales employed gliding gaits during descent, executed a series of lunges at depth and ascended to the surface by steady fluking. Our examination of body kinematics at depth reveals variable lunge-feeding behavior in the context of distinct kinematic modes, which exhibit temporal coordination of rotational torques with translational accelerations. Maximum swimming speeds during lunges match previous estimates of the flow-induced pressure needed to completely expand the buccal cavity during feeding.},

Here we review a wide range of morphological studies that enable greater inference of physiological processes. In particular, we focus on baleen whales that exhibit extensive diving and foraging adaptations. Using morphological data, we (i) explore the biomechanics and sensory physiology of lunge-feeding rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae), (ii) determine the effects of scale and diving pressures on the circulatory physiology of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus (L., 1758)), and (iii) better understand the adaptations of the cetacean respiratory system that facilitate a fully aquatic life history. These studies underscore the value of understanding functional morphology in animals that cannot be studied using traditional laboratory techniques.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the baleen or whalebone whales (Mysticeti), one of the two recent (non-fossil) cetacean suborders. Modern baleen whales differ from the other suborder (toothed whales, Odontoceti), particularly in their lack of functional teeth. Instead they feed, on relatively very small marine organisms, by means of a highly specialized filter-feeding apparatus made up of baleen plates ("whalebone") attached to the gum of the upper jaw. Other differences from toothed whales include the baleen whales' paired blowhole, symmetrical skull, and absence of ribs articulating with the sternum. Baleen whales are generally huge. The blue whale, the largest known animal, grows to more than 30 m long and weighs more than 170 tons. Like all other cetaceans, baleen whales are totally aquatic, and like most of the toothed whales, they are all marine. Many undertake very long migrations, and some are fast swimming. A few species come close to the coast at some part of their life cycle and may be seen from shore; however, much of their life is spent far from land in the deep oceans. Baleen whale females grow slightly larger than the males. Animals of the same species tend to be larger in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2009 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding in rorqual whales is a drag-based feeding mechanism that is thought to entail a high energetic cost and consequently limit the maximum dive time of these extraordinarily large predators. Although the kinematics of lunge feeding in fin whales supports this hypothesis, it is unclear whether respiratory compensation occurs as a consequence of lunge-feeding activity. We used high-resolution digital tags on foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) to determine the number of lunges executed per dive as well as respiratory frequency between dives. Data from two whales are reported, which together performed 58 foraging dives and 451 lunges. During one study, we tracked one tagged whale for approximately 2 h and examined the spatial distribution of prey using a digital echosounder. These data were integrated with the dive profile to reveal that lunges are directed toward the upper boundary of dense krill aggregations. Foraging dives were characterized by a gliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady swimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these extended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken after a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half of those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales. At the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate was at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that underwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high energetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also occurs in intermediate sized rorquals.},

abstract = {Many diving seabirds and marine mammals have been found to regularly exceed their theoretical aerobic dive limit (TADL). No animals have been found to dive for durations that are consistently shorter than their TADL. We attached time-depth recorders to 7 blue whales and 15 fin whales (family Balaenopteridae). The diving behavior of both species was similar, and we distinguished between foraging and traveling dives. Foraging dives in both species were deeper, longer in duration and distinguished by a series of vertical excursions where lunge feeding presumably occurred. Foraging blue whales lunged 2.4 (+/-1.13) times per dive, with a maximum of six times and average vertical excursion of 30.2 (+/-10.04) m. Foraging fin whales lunged 1.7 (+/-0.88) times per dive, with a maximum of eight times and average vertical excursion of 21.2 (+/-4.35) m. The maximum rate of ascent of lunges was higher than the maximum rate of descent in both species, indicating that feeding lunges occurred on ascent. Foraging dives were deeper and longer than non-feeding dives in both species. On average, blue whales dived to 140.0 (+/-46.01) m and 7.8 (+/-1.89) min when foraging, and 67.6 (+/-51.46) m and 4.9 (+/-2.53) min when not foraging. Fin whales dived to 97.9 (+/-32.59) m and 6.3 (+/-1.53) min when foraging and to 59.3 (+/-29.67) m and 4.2 (+/-1.67) min when not foraging. The longest dives recorded for both species, 14.7 min for blue whales and 16.9 min for fin whales, were considerably shorter than the TADL of 31.2 and 28.6 min, respectively. An allometric comparison of seven families diving to an average depth of 80-150 m showed a significant relationship between body mass and dive duration once Balaenopteridae whales, with a mean dive duration of 6.8 min, were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the short dive durations of blue whales and fin whales cannot be explained by the shallow distribution of their prey. We propose instead that short duration diving in large whales results from either: (1) dispersal behavior of prey; or (2) a high energetic cost of foraging.},

Here, we used controlled exposure experiments with simulated military sonar and other mid-frequency sounds to measure behavioural responses of tagged blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) in feeding areas within the Southern California Bight. Despite using source levels orders of magnitude below some operational military systems, our results demonstrate that mid-frequency sound can significantly affect blue whale behaviour, especially during deep feeding modes. When a response occurred, behavioural changes varied widely from cessation of deep feeding to increased swimming speed and directed travel away from the sound source. The variability of these behavioural responses was largely influenced by a complex interaction of behavioural state, the type of mid-frequency sound and received sound level. Sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.},

abstract = {There have been numerous reports of humpback whales and other marine predators deploying bubbles during foraging activities. However, the effects of bubbles on schooling prey organisms remain poorly understood. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to gain insight into the effect of bubbles on the Pacific herring, Clupra harengus pallasi, a principal prey species of the humpback whale, Megupreru novaeangliue. The fish exhibited strong avoidance of bubbles and could be contained within a circular bubble net. The herring schools were also reluctant to swim through a curtain of bubbles even when frightened. However, herring were much more willing to cross a bubble curtain or net if there was a larger aggregation of fish on the opposite side. Individuals and small groups of herring also waited for less time before crossing than did larger groups. These experiments suggest that herring have a strong fear of bubbles and can readily be manipulated or contained within bubble nets by predators.},

New technology has recently improved historical misconceptions about the natural variation in rorqual lunge-feeding behavior yet missing from the literature is a dedicated study of the identification, use, and evolution of these behaviors when used to capture prey at the surface. Here we present results from a long-term investigation of three rorqual whale species (minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata; fin whale, B. physalus; and blue whale, B. musculus) that helped us develop a standardized classification system of surface lunge-feeding (SLF) behaviors. We then tested for differences in frequency of these behaviors among the three species and across all rorqual species. Our results: (1) propose a unified classification system of six homologous SLF behaviors used by all living rorqual whale species; (2) demonstrate statistically significant differences in the frequency of each behavior by minke, fin, and blue whales; and (3) provide new information regarding the evolution of lunge-feeding behaviors among rorqual whales.},

abstract = {Toothed whales (Cetacea, odontoceti) emit sound pulses to probe their surroundings by active echolocation. Non-invasive, acoustic Dtags were placed on deep-diving Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) to record their ultrasonic clicks and the returning echoes from prey items, providing a unique view on how a whale operates its biosonar during foraging in the wild. The process of echolocation during prey capture in this species can be divided into search, approach and terminal phases, as in echolocating bats. The approach phase, defined by the onset of detectable echoes recorded on the tag for click sequences terminated by a buzz, has interclick intervals (ICI) of 300-400 ms. These ICIs are more than a magnitude longer than the decreasing two-way travel time to the targets, showing that ICIs are not given by the two-way-travel times plus a fixed, short lag time. During the approach phase, the received echo energy increases by 10.4(+/-2) dB when the target range is halved, demonstrating that the whales do not employ range-compensating gain control of the transmitter, as has been implicated for some bats and dolphins. The terminal/buzz phase with ICIs of around 10 ms is initiated when one or more targets are within approximately a body length of the whale (2-5 m), so that strong echo returns in the approach phase are traded for rapid updates in the terminal phase. It is suggested that stable ICIs in the search and approach phases facilitate auditory scene analysis in a complex multi-target environment, and that a concomitant low click rate allows the whales to maintain high sound pressure outputs for prey detection and discrimination with a pneumatically driven, bi-modal sound generator.},

abstract = {Sound-and-orientation recording tags (DTAGs) were used to study 10 beaked whales of two poorly known species, Ziphius cavirostris (Zc) and Mesoplodon densirostris (Md). Acoustic behaviour in the deep foraging dives performed by both species (Zc: 28 dives by seven individuals; Md: 16 dives by three individuals) shows that they hunt by echolocation in deep water between 222 and 1885 m, attempting to capture about 30 prey/dive. This food source is so deep that the average foraging dives were deeper (Zc: 1070 m; Md: 835 m) and longer (Zc: 58 min; Md: 47 min) than reported for any other air-breathing species. A series of shallower dives, containing no indications of foraging, followed most deep foraging dives. The average interval between deep foraging dives was 63 min for Zc and 92 min for Md. This long an interval may be required for beaked whales to recover from an oxygen debt accrued in the deep foraging dives, which last about twice the estimated aerobic dive limit. Recent reports of gas emboli in beaked whales stranded during naval sonar exercises have led to the hypothesis that their deep-diving may make them especially vulnerable to decompression. Using current models of breath-hold diving, we infer that their natural diving behaviour is inconsistent with known problems of acute nitrogen supersaturation and embolism. If the assumptions of these models are correct for beaked whales, then possible decompression problems are more likely to result from an abnormal behavioural response to sonar.},

The primary task of a theory of feeding strategies is to specify for a given animal that complex of behavior and morphology best suited to gather food energy in a particular environment. The task is one, therefore, of optimization, and like all optimization problems, it may be tri sected: 1. Choosing a currency: What is to be maximized or minimized? 2. Choosing the appropriate cost-benefit functions: What is the mathematical form of the set of expressions with the currency as the dependent variable? 3. Solving for the optimum: What computational technique best finds ex trema of the cost-benefit function? In this review, most of the following section is devoted to possible answers to the first problem. Then four key aspects of feeding strategies will be considered: (a) the optimal diet, (b) the optimal foraging space, (c) the optimal foraging period, and (d) the optimal foraging-group size. For each, possible cost-benefit formulations will be discussed and compared, and predictions derived from these will be matched with data from the literature on feeding. Because the third problem is an aspect of applied mathematics, it will be mostly ignored. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on strategic aspects of feeding rather than on what Holling (75) has called "tactics."},

abstract = { Definitive studies on the response of marine mammals to anthropogenic sound are hampered by the short surface time and deep-diving lifestyle of many species. A novel archival tag, called the DTAG, has been developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment. Several deployments have included sound playbacks to the tagged whale and a transient response to at least one playback is evident in the tag data.},

abstract = {We present a new model for calculating locomotion costs in breath-hold divers. Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag, the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into account the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings (Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.},

abstract = {Fin whales Balaenoptera physalus exhibit one of the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. Fin whales, and other rorquals (Balaenopteridae), lunge with their mouth fully agape, thereby generating dynamic pressure to stretch their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water, which is then filtered by racks of baleen. Despite their large body size, fin whales appear to be limited to short dive durations, likely because of the energetic cost associated with large accelerations of the body during several lunges at depth. Here, we incorporate kinematic data from high-resolution digital tags and morphological data of the engulfment apparatus in a simple mechanical model to estimate the drag acting on a lunge-feeding fin whale. This model also allowed us to quantify the amount of water and prey obtained in a single lunge. Our analysis suggests that the reconfiguration and expansion of the buccal cavity enables an adult fin whale to engulf approximately 60 to 82 m3 of water, a volume greater than its entire body. This large engulfment capacity, however, comes at a high cost because the drag, work against drag, and drag coefficient dramatically increase over the course of a lunge. As a result, kinetic energy is rapidly dissipated from the body, and each subsequent lunge requires acceleration from rest. Despite this high cost, living balaenopterids are not only among the largest animals on earth, but are relatively speciose and exhibit diverse prey preferences. Given this ecological diversity, we frame our results in an evolutionary context, and address the implications of our results for the origin of lunge feeding.},

The cause of the mortalities remains unknown, but starvation resulting from a reduction in prey, especially in the Chirikov Basin, was suggested as the cause. In the 1980s, the Chirikov Basin was considered a prime gray whale feeding area, but there has been no recent comprehensive assessment of whale or prey distribution and abundance. In 2002, a 5-day survey for gray whales revealed restricted distribution in the basin and a 3- to 17-fold decline in sighting rates. To put these data in context, a retrospective summary of gray whale and benthic fauna distribution and abundance was undertaken. During the 1980s, gray whale sighting rates in the Chirikov Basin were highly variable. Ampeliscid amphipods dominated the benthos where gray whale sighting rates were highest. Available measures of biomass suggest a downturn in amphipod productivity from 1983 to 2000, when estimates of gray whale population size were increasing, suggesting that the whales simply expanded their foraging range. We encourage long-term study of the Chirikov Basin as a location where predatorprey responses to changing ocean climate can be researched, because decadal time series data are available},

A class of multisensor, suction-cup-attached archival tags has revolutionized the study of large baleen whales, particularly with respect to the predatory strategies used by these gigantic bulk filter feeders to exploit abundant oceanic resources. By integrating these data with those from other disciplines, researchers have uncovered a diverse and extraordinary set of underwater behaviors, ranging from acrobatic diving maneuvers to extreme feeding events during which whales engulf volumes of prey-laden water that are much larger than their own body.

abstract = {Body size has widely been recognized as one of the most important determinants of organismal form and function (1). Extremes in size can be especially illuminating of the drivers and constraints in body size evolution, and marine mammals provide a remarkable set of test cases because their independent invasions of the sea have produced a stunning array of sizes, from sea otters to blue whales that span several orders of magnitude in body mass. Why should whales have become so huge and why aren't they larger? One scale-dependent physiological process that may shed light on these questions relates to energy flux: how animals obtain energy from the environment and how they use stored energy (2). Although larger animals have higher absolute metabolic requirements than smaller ones, the rates are not proportional to body size (3). The negative allometry of metabolic rate, whereby larger animals exhibit lower mass-specific rates of metabolism, confers a suite of physiological and ecological benefits at greater body sizes. These advantages include a low cost of transport (4); enhanced fasting ability (5); and, for air-breathers in aquatic environments, the ability to dive longer and deeper in search of food (6). There is a tendency of many vertebrate lineages to increase body size through time, but the environmental drivers and physiological constraints of body size evolution remain poorly understood. In PNAS, Gearty et al. (7) analyze the evolution of body size in several independent mammalian lineages that underwent land-to-sea transitions in their evolutionary histories. They use comparative phylogenetic analyses and an examination of the fossil record to test several hypotheses that attempt to explain why mammals evolved larger size in aquatic ecosystems. Physical and energetic constraints on maximum body size are a common theme in several previously proposed hypotheses regarding the phenomenon of large mammals in the ocean. {\ldots} [↵][1]1Email: jergold{at}stanford.edu.

abstract = {When feeding, most aquatic organisms generate suction that draws prey into the mouth. The papers in this volume are a demonstration of this fact. However, under what circumstances is suction ineffective as a feeding mechanism? Here we consider the interplay between suction, ram, and biting, and analyze the contribution of each to the capture of prey by a wide variety of species of fish. We find, not surprisingly, that ram is the dominant contributor to feeding because suction, and biting, are only effective when very close to the prey. As species utilize more strongly ram-dominated modes of feeding, they may be released from the morphological and behavioral constraints associated with the need to direct a current of water into the head. Morphological and behavioral changes that facilitate larger gapes and stronger jaws are explored here, including predators that lack a protrusile upper jaw, predators with elongate jaws, predators that rely on suspension feeding, and predators that bite. Interestingly, while the mobility of the jaws and the shape of the opening of the mouth are modified in species that have departed from a primary reliance on suction feeding, the anterior-to-posterior wave of expansion persists. This wave may be greatly slowed in ram and biting species, but its retention suggests a fundamental importance to aquatic feeding.},

abstract = {1. Breath-hold divers are widely assumed to descend and ascend at the speed that minimizes energy expenditure per distance travelled (the cost of transport (COT)) to maximize foraging duration at depth. However, measuring COT with captive animals is difficult, and empirical support for this hypothesis is sparse. 2. We examined the scaling relationship of swim speed in free-ranging diving birds, mammals and turtles (37 species; mass range, 0{\textperiodcentered}5-90,000 kg) with phylogenetically informed statistical methods and derived the theoretical prediction for the allometric exponent under the COT hypothesis by constructing a biomechanical model. 3. Swim speed significantly increased with mass, despite considerable variations around the scaling line. The allometric exponent (0{\textperiodcentered}09) was statistically consistent with the theoretical prediction (0{\textperiodcentered}05) of the COT hypothesis. 4. Our finding suggests a previously unrecognized advantage of size in divers: larger animals swim faster and thus could travel longer distance, search larger volume of water for prey and exploit a greater range of depths during a given dive duration. 5. Furthermore, as predicted from the model, endotherms (birds and mammals) swam faster than ectotherms (turtles) for their size, suggesting that metabolic power production limits swim speed. Among endotherms, birds swam faster than mammals, which cannot be explained by the model. Reynolds numbers of small birds (<2 kg) were close to the lower limit of turbulent flow (∼ 3 × 10(5) ), and they swam fast possibly to avoid the increased drag associated with flow transition.},

abstract = {Groups of female and immature sperm whales live at low latitudes and show a stereotypical diving and foraging behavior with dives lasting about 45 min to depths of between 400 and 1200 m. In comparison, physically mature male sperm whales migrate to high latitudes where little is known about their foraging behavior and ecology. Here we use acoustic recording tags to study the diving and acoustic behavior of male sperm whales foraging off northern Norway. Sixty-five hours of tag data provide detailed information about the movements and sound repertoire of four male sperm whales performing 83 dives lasting between 6 and 60 min. Dives ranged in depth between 14 and 1860 m, with a median depth of 175 m, and 92% of the surfacings lasted less than 15 min. The four whales clicked for an average 91% (SD = 10) of the dive duration, where the first usual click was produced at depths ranging between 4 and 218 m and the last usual click at depths ranging between 1 and 1114 m. Echolocation buzzes, which are used as an indication of prey capture attempts, were emitted at depths between 17 and 1860 m, during both the descent and ascent phase of deep dives. The foraging behavior varied markedly with depth, with the timing and duration of prey capture attempts during shallow dives suggesting that the whales target more sparsely distributed prey. In contrast, deep dives involve frequent prey capture attempts and seem to target more dense food layers. The evidence of exploitation of different food layers, including epipelagic prey, is consistent with the hypothesis that male sperm whales may migrate to high latitudes to access a productive, multi-layered foraging habitat.},

Many rorqual whale species lunge feed at the surface, yet existing methodologies for detecting lunges in accelerometer data have not been applied to surface-feeding behavior. Our study aimed to develop a method to detect surface-feeding behavior in accelerometer data and in doing so, determine whether wave drag influences the detection of surface-feeding behavior. A new acceleration parameter is described that considers the forward acceleration of the animal relative to its pitch. The new parameter, along with information on the deceleration and pitch angle, was then used in an automatic lunge detecting algorithm followed by a visual classification method that detected approximately 70% of the lunges observed during focal follow sampling. The forward acceleration of lunges decreased significantly with increasing proximity to the surface. This lower acceleration at the surface may influence the ability to detect lunge feeding behavior close to the surface. Future research should attempt to determine the cause of this relationship, which may be the influence of changes in the forces acting on the whale or behavioral flexibility by the whale.},

abstract = {Simultaneous high resolution sampling of predator behavior and habitat characteristics is often difficult to achieve despite its importance in understanding the foraging decisions and habitat use of predators. Here we tap into the biosonar system of Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, using sound and orientation recording tags to uncover prey-finding cues available to echolocating predators in the deep-sea. Echolocation sounds indicate where whales search and encounter prey, as well as the altitude of whales above the sea-floor and the density of organisms around them, providing a link between foraging activity and the bio-physical environment. Tagged whales (n = 9) hunted exclusively at depth, investing most of their search time either in the lower part of the deep scattering layer (DSL) or near the sea-floor with little diel change. At least 43% (420/974) of recorded prey-capture attempts were performed within the benthic boundary layer despite a wide range of dive depths, and many dives included both meso- and bentho-pelagic foraging. Blainville's beaked whales only initiate searching when already deep in the descent and encounter prey suitable for capture within 2 min of the start of echolocation, suggesting that these whales are accessing prey in reliable vertical strata. Moreover, these prey resources are sufficiently dense to feed the animals in what is effectively four hours of hunting per day enabling a strategy in which long dives to exploit numerous deep-prey with low nutritional value require protracted recovery periods (average 1.5 h) between dives. This apparent searching efficiency maybe aided by inhabiting steep undersea slopes with access to both the DSL and the sea-floor over small spatial scales. Aggregations of prey in these biotopes are located using biosonar-derived landmarks and represent stable and abundant resources for Blainville's beaked whales in the otherwise food-limited deep-ocean.},

abstract = {A key component in understanding the ecological role of marine mammal predators is to identify how, where and how much prey they capture in time and space. Satellite and archival tags on pinnipeds generally only provide diving and positioning information, and foraging is often inferred to take place in particular shaped dives or when the animal remains in an area for an extended interval. However, fast movements of the head and jaws may provide reliable feeding cues that can be detected by small low-power accelerometers mounted on the head. To test this notion, a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) was trained to wear an OpenTag (sampling at 200 or 333 Hz with ±2 or ±16 g clipping) on its head while catching fish prey in front of four underwater digital high-speed video cameras. We show that both raptorial and suction feeding generate jerk (i.e., differential of acceleration) signatures with maximum peak values exceeding 1000 m/s3. We conclude that reliable prey capture cues can be derived from fast-sampling, head mounted accelerometer tags thus holding a promising potential for long-term studies of foraging ecology and field energetics of aquatic predators in their natural environments.},

Here we describe the first recordings of click production associated with underwater lunges from baleen whales. Recordings of over 34000 'megapclicks' from two whales indicated relatively low received levels at the tag (between 143 and 154dB re 1 microPa pp), most energy below 2kHz, and interclick intervals often decreasing towards the end of click trains to form a buzz. All clicks were recorded during night-time hours. Sharp body rolls also occurred at the end of click bouts containing buzzes, suggesting feeding events. This acoustic behaviour seems to form part of a night-time feeding tactic for humpbacks and also expands the known acoustic repertoire of baleen whales in general.},

abstract = {1. Empirical testing of optimal foraging models for breath-hold divers has been difficult. Here we report data from sound and movement recording DTags placed on 23 short-finned pilot whales off Tenerife to study the foraging strategies used to catch deep-water prey. 2. Day and night foraging dives had a maximum depth and duration of 1018 m and 21 min. Vocal behaviour during dives was consistent with biosonar-based foraging, with long series of echolocation clicks interspersed with buzzes. Similar buzzes have been associated with prey capture attempts in other echolocating species. 3. Foraging dives seemed to adapt to circadian rhythms. Deep dives during the day were deeper, but contained fewer buzzes (median 1), than night-time deep dives (median 5 buzzes). 4. In most deep (540-1019 m) daytime dives with buzzes, a downward directed sprint reaching up to 9 m s(-1) occurred just prior to a buzz and coincided with the deepest point in the dive, suggestive of a chase after escaping prey. 5. A large percentage (10-36%) of the drag-related locomotion cost of these dives (15 min long) is spent in sprinting (19-79 s). This energetic foraging tactic focused on a single or few prey items has not been observed previously in deep-diving mammals but resembles the high-risk/high-gain strategy of some terrestrial hunters such as cheetahs. 6. Deep sprints contrast with the expectation that deep-diving mammals will swim at moderate speeds optimized to reduce oxygen consumption and maximize foraging time at depth. Pilot whales may have developed this tactic to target a deep-water niche formed by large/calorific/fast moving prey such as giant squid.},

abstract = {Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) represent not only some of the largest animals of all time, but also exhibit a wide range in intraspecific and interspecific body size. Balaenopterids are characterized by their extreme lunge-feeding behaviour, a dynamic process that involves the engulfment of a large volume of prey-laden water at a high energetic cost. To investigate the consequences of scale and morphology on lunge-feeding performance, we determined allometric equations for fin whale body dimensions and engulfment capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that larger fin whales have larger skulls and larger buccal cavities relative to body size. Together, these data suggest that engulfment volume is also allometric, increasing with body length as Graphic. The positive allometry of the skull is accompanied by negative allometry in the tail region. The relative shortening of the tail may represent a trade-off for investing all growth-related resources in the anterior region of the body. Although enhanced engulfment volume will increase foraging efficiency, the work (energy) required to accelerate the engulfed water mass during engulfment will be relatively higher in larger rorquals. If the mass-specific energetic cost of a lunge increases with body size, it will have major consequences for rorqual foraging ecology and evolution.},

Anatomic relationships and biomechanical findings predict that this structure would control and assist a process of continuous change in position of the jaws during engulfment events.

At the extreme of maximum body size observed among mammals, baleen whales exhibit a unique combination of high overall energetic demands and low mass-specific metabolic rates. As a result, most baleen whale species have evolved filter-feeding mechanisms and foraging strategies that take advantage of seasonally abundant yet patchily and ephemerally distributed prey resources. New methodologies consisting of multi-sensor tags, active acoustic prey mapping, and hydrodynamic modeling have revolutionized our ability to study the physiology and ecology of baleen whale feeding mechanisms.

abstract = {Bulk-filter feeding is an energetically efficient strategy for resource acquisition and assimilation, and facilitates the maintenance of extreme body size as exemplified by baleen whales (Mysticeti) and multiple lineages of bony and cartilaginous fishes. Among mysticetes, rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) exhibit an intermittent ram filter feeding mode, lunge feeding, which requires the abandonment of body-streamlining in favor of a high-drag, mouth-open configuration aimed at engulfing a very large amount of prey-laden water. Particularly while lunge feeding on krill (the most widespread prey preference among rorquals), the effort required during engulfment involve short bouts of high-intensity muscle activity that demand high metabolic output. We used computational modeling together with morphological and kinematic data on humpback (Megaptera noveaangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whales to estimate engulfment power output in comparison with standard metrics of metabolic rate. The simulations reveal that engulfment metabolism increases across the full body size of the larger rorqual species to nearly 50 times the basal metabolic rate of terrestrial mammals of the same body mass. Moreover, they suggest that the metabolism of the largest body sizes runs with significant oxygen deficits during mouth opening, namely, 20% over maximum [Formula: see text]at the size of the largest blue whales, thus requiring significant contributions from anaerobic catabolism during a lunge and significant recovery after a lunge. Our analyses show that engulfment metabolism is also significantly lower for smaller adults, typically one-tenth to one-half [Formula: see text]. These results not only point to a physiological limit on maximum body size in this lineage, but also have major implications for the ontogeny of extant rorquals as well as the evolutionary pathways used by ancestral toothed whales to transition from hunting individual prey items to filter feeding on prey aggregations.},

abstract = {Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0{+/-}0.32 m s-1) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at $\sim$1-1.5 m s-1 after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46 s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge.},

These powerful tools have led to a wide range of insights into the behaviour of marine animals and have opened new opportunities for studying the ways they interact with their environment. Acoustic tags demand new analysis methods and careful experimental design to optimize the consistency between research objectives and the realistic performance of the tags. Technical details to consider are the suitability of the tag attachment to a given species, the accuracy of the tag sensors, and the recording and attachment duration of the tag. Here we consider the achievements, potential, and limitations of acoustic recording tags in studying the behaviour, habitat use and sensory ecology of marine mammals, the taxon to which this technology has been most often applied. We examine the application of acoustic tags to studies of vocal behaviour, foraging ecology, acoustic tracking, and the effects of noise to assess both the breadth of applications and the specific issues that arise in each.},

abstract = {Terrestrial predators can modulate the energy used for prey capture to maximize efficiency, but diving animals face the conflicting metabolic demands of energy intake and the minimization of oxygen depletion during a breath hold. It is thought that diving predators optimize their foraging success when oxygen use and energy gain act as competing currencies, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested because it has been difficult to measure the quality of prey that is targeted by free-ranging animals. We used high-resolution multisensor digital tags attached to foraging blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) with concurrent acoustic prey measurements to quantify foraging performance across depth and prey density gradients. We parameterized two competing physiological models to estimate energy gain and expenditure based on foraging decisions. Our analyses show that at low prey densities, blue whale feeding rates and energy intake were low to minimize oxygen use, but at higher prey densities feeding frequency increased to maximize energy intake. Contrary to previous paradigms, we demonstrate that blue whales are not indiscriminate grazers but instead switch foraging strategies in response to variation in prey density and depth to maximize energetic efficiency.},

abstract = {Beaked whales (Cetacea: Ziphiidea) of the genera Ziphius and Mesoplodon are so difficult to study that they are mostly known from strandings. How these elusive toothed whales use and react to sound is of concern because they mass strand during naval sonar exercises. A new non-invasive acoustic ording tag was attached to four beaked whales(two Mesoplodon densirostris and two Ziphius cavirostris) and recorded high-frequency clicks during deep dives. The tagged whales only clicked at depths below 200 m, down to a maximum depth of 1267 m. Both species produced a large number of short, directional, ultrasonic clicks with significant energy below 20 kHz. The tags recorded echoes from prey items; to our knowledge, a first for any animal echolocating in the wild. As far as we are aware, these echoes provide the first direct evidence on how free-ranging toothed whales use echolocation in foraging. The strength of these echoes suggests that the source level of Mesoplodon clicks is in the range of 200-220 dB re 1 microPa at 1 m. This paper presents conclusive data on the normal vocalizations of these beaked whale species, which may enable acoustic monitoring to mitigate exposure to sounds intense enough to harm them.},

Here, we quantify the sound exposure levels recorded on acoustic tags attached to eight sperm whales at ranges between 1.4 and 12.6 km from controlled air-gun array sources operated in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to multipath propagation, the animals were exposed to multiple sound pulses during each firing of the array with received levels of analyzed pulses falling between 131–167 dB re. 1 µPa (pp) [111–147 dB re. 1 µPa (rms) and 100–135 dB re. 1 µPa2 s] after compensation for hearing sensitivity using the M-weighting. Received levels varied widely with range and depth of the exposed animal precluding reliable estimation of exposure zones based on simple geometric spreading laws. When whales were close to the surface, the first arrivals of air-gun pulses contained most energy between 0.3 and 3 kHz, a frequency range well beyond the normal frequencies of interest in seismic exploration. Therefore air-gun arrays can generate significant sound energy at frequencies many octaves higher than the frequencies of interest for seismic exploration, which increases concern of the potential impact on odontocetes with poor low frequency hearing.},

abstract = {Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either ‘prey handling' or ‘swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26% (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more ‘wiggles' and ‘dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales.},

abstract = {The introduction of animal-borne, multisensor tags has opened up many opportunities for ecological research, making previously inaccessible species and behaviors observable. The advancement of tag technology and the increasingly widespread use of bio-logging tags are leading to large volumes of sometimes extremely detailed data. With the increasing quantity and duration of tag deployments, a set of tools needs to be developed to aid in facilitating and standardizing the analysis of movement sensor data. Here, we developed an observation-based decision tree method to detect feeding events in data from multisensor movement tags attached to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Fin whales exhibit an energetically costly and kinematically complex foraging behavior called lunge feeding, an intermittent ram filtration mechanism. Using this automated system, we identified feeding lunges in 19 fin whales tagged with multisensor tags, during a total of over 100 h of continuously sampled data. Using movement sensor and hydrophone data, the automated lunge detector correctly identified an average of 92.8% of all lunges, with a false-positive rate of 9.5%. The strong performance of our automated feeding detector demonstrates an effective, straightforward method of activity identification in animal-borne movement tag data. Our method employs a detection algorithm that utilizes a hierarchy of simple thresholds based on knowledge of observed features of feeding behavior, a technique that is readily modifiable to fit a variety of species and behaviors. Using automated methods to detect behavioral events in tag records will significantly decrease data analysis time and aid in standardizing analysis methods, crucial objectives with the rapidly increasing quantity and variety of on-animal tag data. Furthermore, our results have implications for next-generation tag design, especially long-term tags that can be outfitted with on-board processing algorithms that automatically detect kinematic events and transmit ethograms via acoustic or satellite telemetry.},

abstract = {Here we use sound and movement recording tags to study how deep-diving Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) use echolocation to forage in their natural mesopelagic habitat. These whales ensonify thousands of organisms per dive but select only about 25 prey for capture. They negotiate their cluttered environment by radiating sound in a narrow 20° field of view which they sample with 1.5-3 clicks per metre travelled requiring only some 60 clicks to locate, select and approach each prey. Sampling rates do not appear to be defined by the range to individual targets, but rather by the movement of the predator. Whales sample faster when they encounter patches of prey allowing them to search new water volumes while turning rapidly to stay within a patch. This implies that the Griffin search-approach-capture model of biosonar foraging must be expanded to account for sampling behaviours adapted to the overall prey distribution. Beaked whales can classify prey at more than 15 m range adopting stereotyped motor patterns when approaching some prey. This long detection range relative to swimming speed facilitates a deliberate mode of sensory-motor operation in which prey and capture tactics can be selected to optimize energy returns during long breath-hold dives.},

We show that the rate at which whales recovered from a foraging dive was twice that of a non-foraging dive and that the cost of foraging relative to the cost of travel to and from the prey patch was 3.15 in blue whales (95 % CI 2.58-3.72) and 3.60 in fin whales (95 % CI 2.35-4.85). Whales foraged in small areas (<1 km(2)) and foraging bouts lasted more than one dive, indicating that prey did not disperse and thus that prey dispersal could not account for the limited dive durations of the whales. Despite the enormous size of blue whales and fin whales, the high energetic costs of lunge-feeding confine them to short durations of submergence and to areas with dense prey aggregations. As a corollary, because of their limited foraging time under water, these whales may be particularly vulnerable to perturbations in prey abundance.},

abstract = {In southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), fasting and foraging related fluctuations in body composition are reflected by buoyancy changes. Such buoyancy changes can be monitored by measuring changes in the rate at which a seal drifts passively through the water column, i.e. when all active swimming motion ceases. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based method for detecting buoyancy changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. By step-wise filtering of the dive data, the developed algorithm identifies fragments of dives that correspond to times when animals drift. In the dive records of eleven southern elephant seals from South Georgia, this filtering method identified 0.8% to 2.2% of all dives as drift dives, indicating large individual variation in drift diving behaviour. The obtained drift rate time series exhibit that, at the beginning of each migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75 to 150 days, the buoyancy of all individuals peaked close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal's foraging success. Independent verification with visually inspected detailed high-resolution dive data confirmed that this method is capable of reliably detecting buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted data. This also affirms that abstracted dive profiles convey the geometric shape of drift dives in sufficient detail for them to be identified. Further, it suggest that, using this step-wise filtering method, buoyancy changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.},

abstract = {Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris Blainville) echolocate for prey during deep foraging dives. Here we use acoustic tags to demonstrate that these whales, in contrast to other toothed whales studied, produce two distinct types of click sounds during different phases in biosonar-based foraging. Search clicks are emitted during foraging dives with inter-click intervals typically between 0.2 and 0.4 s. They have the distinctive form of an FM upsweep (modulation rate of about 110 kHz ms(-1)) with a -10 dB bandwidth from 26 to 51 kHz and a pulse length of 270 micros, somewhat similar to chirp signals in bats and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris Cuvier), but quite different from clicks of other toothed whales studied. In comparison, the buzz clicks, produced in short bursts during the final stage of prey capture, are short (105 micros) transients with no FM structure and a -10 dB bandwidth from 25 to 80 kHz or higher. Buzz clicks have properties similar to clicks reported from large delphinids and hold the potential for higher temporal resolution than the FM clicks. It is suggested that the two click types are adapted to the separate problems of target detection and classification versus capture of low target strength prey in a cluttered acoustic environment.},

abstract = {Balaenid whales perform long breath-hold foraging dives despite a high drag from their ram filtration of zooplankton. To maximize the volume of prey acquired in a dive with limited oxygen supplies, balaenids must either filter feed only occasionally when prey density is particularly high, or they must swim at slow speeds while filtering to reduce drag and oxygen consumption. Using digital tags with three-axis accelerometers, we studied bowhead whales feeding off West Greenland and present here, to our knowledge, the first detailed data on the kinematics and swimming behaviour of a balaenid whale filter feeding at depth. Bowhead whales employ a continuous fluking gait throughout the bottom phase of foraging dives, moving at very slow speeds (less than 1 m s(-1)), allowing them to filter feed continuously at depth. Despite the slow speeds, the large mouth aperture provides a water filtration rate of approximately 3 m(3) s(-1), amounting to some 2000 tonnes of water and prey filtered per dive. We conclude that a food niche of dense, slow-moving zooplankton prey has led balaenids to evolve locomotor and filtering systems adapted to work against a high drag at swimming speeds of less than 0.07 body length s(-1) using a continuous fluking gait very different from that of nekton-feeding, aquatic predators.},

The finer filtration capacity of the baleen allows predation on smaller prey spectra as a skim-feeder, with the option to engulf where prey are larger, or in greater densities. The sei whale exhibits some features of the mouth cross-section which are reminiscent of right whales (Eubalaena sp.) and there appears to be a difference in the degree of arch of the rostrum when comparing the sexes.

abstract = {Toothed whales echolocating in the wild generate clicks with low repetition rates to locate prey but then produce rapid sequences of clicks, called buzzes, when attempting to capture prey. However, little is known about the factors that determine clicking rates or how prey type and behaviour influence echolocation-based foraging. Here we study Blainville's beaked whales foraging in deep water using a multi-sensor DTAG that records both outgoing echolocation clicks and echoes returning from mesopelagic prey. We demonstrate that the clicking rate at the beginning of buzzes is related to the distance between whale and prey, supporting the presumption that whales focus on a specific prey target during the buzz. One whale showed a bimodal relationship between target range and clicking rate producing abnormally slow buzz clicks while attempting to capture large echoic targets, probably schooling prey, with echo duration indicating a school diameter of up to 4.3m. These targets were only found when the whale performed tight circling manoeuvres spending up to five times longer in water volumes with large targets than with small targets. The result indicates that toothed whales in the wild can adjust their echolocation behaviour and movement for capture of different prey on the basis of structural echo information.},

abstract = {Reports of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song chorusing occurring outside the breeding grounds are becoming more common, but song structure and underwater behavior of individual singers on feeding grounds and migration routes remain unknown. Here, ten humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were tagged in May 2010 with non-invasive, suction-cup attached tags to study foraging ecology and acoustic behavior. Background song was identified on all ten records, but additionally, acoustic records of two whales showed intense and continuous singing, with a level of organization and structure approaching that of typical breeding ground song. The songs, produced either by the tagged animals or close associates, shared phrase types and theme structure with one another, and some song bouts lasted close to an hour. Dive behavior of tagged animals during the time of sound production showed song occurring during periods of active diving, sometimes to depths greater than 100 m. One tag record also contained song in the presence of feeding lunges identified from the behavioral sensors, indicating that mating displays occur in areas worthy of foraging. These data show behavioral flexibility as the humpbacks manage competing needs to continue to feed and to prepare for the breeding season during late fall. This may also signify an ability to engage in breeding activities outside of the traditional, warm water breeding ground locations.},

@article{Potvin2009,
abstract = {Lunge-feeding in rorqual whales represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth and one of the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. By accelerating to high speeds and by opening their mouth to large gape angles, these whales generate the water pressure required to expand their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water. Such large influx is facilitated by highly extensible ventral groove blubber (VGB) associated with the walls of the throat (buccal cavity). Based on the mechanical properties of this tissue, previous studies have assumed lunge-feeding to be an entirely passive process, where the flow-induced pressure driving the expansion of the VGB is met with little resistance. Such compliant engulfment would be facilitated by the compliant properties of the VGB that have been measured on dead specimens. However, adjoining the ventral blubber are several layers of well-developed muscle embedded with mechanoreceptors, thereby suggesting a capability to gauge the magnitude of engulfed water and use eccentric muscle action to control the flux of water into the mouth. An unsteady hydrodynamic model of fin whale lunge-feeding is presented here to test whether engulfment is exclusively passive and compliant or involves muscle action. The model is based on the explicit simulation of the engulfed water as it interacts with the buccal cavity walls of the whale, under different heuristically motivated cavity forces. Our results, together with their comparison with velocity data collected in the field, suggest that adult rorquals actively push engulfed water forward from the very onset of mouth opening in order to successfully complete a lunge. Interestingly, such an action involves a reflux of the engulfed mass rather than the oft-assumed rebound, which would occur mainly at the very end of a lunge sequence dominated by compliant engulfment. Given the great mass of the engulfed water, reflux creation adds a significant source of hydrodynamic drag to the lunge process, but with the benefit of helping to circumvent the problem of removing prey from baleen by enhancing the efficiency of cross-flow filtration after mouth closing. Reflux management for a successful lunge will therefore demand well-coordinated muscular actions of the tail, mouth and ventral cavity.},

abstract = {This review discusses the advancements in our understanding of the physiology and behaviour of avian diving that have been underpinned by optimal foraging theory and the testing of optimal models. To maximise their foraging efficiency during foraging periods, diving birds must balance numerous factors that are directly or indirectly related to the replenishment of the oxygen stores and the removal of excess carbon dioxide. These include (1) the time spent underwater (which diminishes the oxygen supply, increases carbon dioxide levels and may even include a build up of lactate due to anaerobic metabolism), (2) the time spent at the surface recovering from the previous dive and preparing for the next (including reloading their oxygen supply, decreasing their carbon dioxide levels and possibly also metabolising lactate) and (3) the trade-off between maximising oxygen reserves for consumption underwater by taking in more air to the respiratory system, and minimising the energy costs of positive buoyancy caused by this air, to maximise the time available underwater to forage. Due to its importance in avian diving, replenishment of the oxygen stores has become integral to models of optimal diving, which predict the time budgeting of animals foraging underwater. While many of these models have been examined qualitatively, such tests of predictive trends appear fallible and only quantifiable support affords strong evidence of their predictive value. This review describes how the quantification of certain optimal diving models, using tufted ducks, indeed demonstrates some predictive success. This suggests that replenishment of the oxygen stores and removal of excess carbon dioxide have significant influences on the duration of the surface period between dives. Nevertheless, present models are too simplistic to be robust predictors of diving behaviour for individual animals and it is proposed that they require refinement through the incorporation of other variables that also influence diving behaviour such as, perhaps, prey density and predator avoidance. ?? 2006.},

Two specific functional innovations that characterize the two great clades of cetaceans, echolocation in toothed whales (Odontoceti) and filter feeding in baleen whales (Mysticeti), provide a powerful comparative framework for integrative studies. Both clades exhibit gigantism in multiple species, but we posit that large body size may have evolved for different reasons and in response to different ecosystem conditions. Although these foraging adaptations have been studied using a combination of experimental and tagging studies, the precise functional drivers and consequences of morphological change within and among these lineages remain less understood.
